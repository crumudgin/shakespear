I couldnt find the floor plans but i found some cool roof plans of how they're changing my floor in gibson next year
Yo who give a fuck about rit past history. Only history that matters is sigs strutting on the 1/4 mile 
TKE used to be where Phi Delt was. TKE took Phi Sig area. Phi Tau area is now KDR. Bruh 
send them floor plans to me boi
ASA lost their place years ago due to complications
And ASA used to have Zeta. Damn 
AXiD used to be where Tri Sigma is
man, I'm about to give you a history lesson
Tau Epsilon Phi
There was also Sigma Pi? 
Idk what TEP is. 
we had like 5-6 sole deaf organizations
Res hall A B and C were Greek af. Holy shit. 
and a ton of organizations that do not exist anymore
Greek's in houses, with kegs, bars etc
reading room or crossroads read the tech mila year book
Side note RIP AEPi. No sign on the mansion 
I talk about it with so many people I thought you knew alreadly
I didn't know this shit do I look old to you? Lol
read up on year books too
dude, that area was all Greek back in the day
The phi sig door sigh is in micginnys
What do you mean by small claimed area
None
And KDR had a small claimed area
Apparently Phi Tau, Phi Sig, ASA, AXiD all used to be in the dorms?
So I got access to some cool RIT floor plan databases 
WVU lowering the standard since 1867
Lol he's reapplying. Nobody but WVU takes a rapist back
He should apply to Colgate then, probably get in
Yes
the screen time dedicated to Greek life was nice
Is he retarded?

Remember kids, sexual assault != rape. But God forbid they tell us that

If it's about gender I'm transferring 
no idea on the topic
Google emette til
The loser always learns more ..take Germans for an example..boy do they know about the holocaust 
also, there's going to be a theater performance for orientation about something

I think southerners get more education about civil rights than northerners in high school actually
Racks
Probably more bike rocks or some shit
How are they teasing

itll max out pretty low

Realistically I'm not gonna need these potions if I'm taking gyms 
I had to do that. Just run around hitting stops and trash some potuons/revives. Only catch worthwhile stuff, and use berries constantly 
Probably gonna hold off on captures for a little bit 
I need poke balls asap

I'll donate 100 bucks but it has to go to incredible hulk©™ dildos from the official Adam and Eve (dot)com 
Hitmonlee behind library 
Dildos to slap people with until they pay dues... Genius 
 Someone may of already said it but I'm too lazy to read through another 50 messages. I'll donate with the written intent purpose of them going to chapter dildos (WASH THEM AFTER USE GUIZZZZZ). If it dosnt go to dildos see you in court lil bitches 
jeez
That awkward moment when a book uses a  Bill Cosby quote, and its "Decide that you want it more than you're afraid of it"
You can donate for it
Dunce cap?
we just shame you
Mmmm okay. 
it's not that hot for that long
You'll get yelled at but there's nothing else we can do officially as the rules currently stand 
Pls confirm elders 
Never been to a chapter meeting when it's balls hot outside 
Am I allowed to wear shorts in all seriousness
There's no dress code in the bylaws

Nib 
Woops didn't notice the highlighted text
6.05.3 doesn't exist in the current bylaws
That's not passed yet jake
Realistically eboard has the final say according to 6.05.3
nothing in there says we are forces to spend the donation
"this money is for the hat restriction to be completed by week 5"
If they put a deadline on it we have to
simply don't use it
something like " this money can only go towards a hat is a restriction"
That's called a restriction when it's attached to a donation 
Might get it for myself for shits and giggles 
right, that's not a restriction that's a request
*it
They can even put a deadline on ot
But.... I still want the turkey hat
In all seriousness I'm pretty sure there's like a fine line for a donation being used 
Donor has absolute freedom in restrictions 
Restriction being "buy the turkey hat and make the consul wear it during non ritual parts of chapter"
I mean eventuallyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
nothing says it must be used 
it just says we honor the restriction, not the spending of it
You have no choice 
"bruh it's for incense"
"Must honor it"
#CrackPipes4All
As the bylaw stands we do
yes we do
Not with the way it's written right now

#TurkeyhatforJustinEng
@Moderator Supreme we don't have that option
"Well shit...it was donated so we gots ta"
Actually no I wanna do it for Justin 
"I'll donate the money only if it goes To hookers and blow"
Not yet
I will protest. Make #turkeyhatforBT s thing
literally just don't use the money
Technically can't the chapter reject the donation? 
This change likely won't go through until at least the 2nd or 3rd week of classes, and by then if we already have the hat...

Sigmachirit.com/donate 
 How can I donate 
So if you want to donate money to buy a dildo hat for the consul to wear at all chapter meetings, we have to buy the dildo hat and the consul has to wear it
So reading over the bylaws, if you donate money for something and the chapter is able to do it, the chapter must do it.

There's a spot on campus that constantly spawns growlithes 
Wouldn't be surprised, they may have programmed it specifically to
I'm pretty sure Pokemon avoid roads too
in about a week, 2000s will be popping up then it will slow down
All hail team valor
If you ain't red you're a fuckin geed
Only for team valor
See u soon
lmao, I'm just gonna leave my multiple 700s over there
Middleburgh ny 12122
Send address pls
I was literally controlling gyms in my town with like an 84 cp spearow
It doubles your xp for half an hour
30 minute double xp
It's a buff, you use it like incense 
Lucky eggs give extra xp while you have them?
The best I've seen was like 450 and I got my shit packed 
Just keep farming a shitload of ratatas and Pidgeys, and then evolve them all at once with a lucky egg on
yall ain't ready 
Yo wtf
that's not even the strongest on campus
None
It scales up really quick on campus, I went from start to 1000+ in about four days
But my best is like 130 CB lol
me, Luther and jake alone took like 3
And yeah, groups can swarm gyms
and it's easy to level up
We're thinking it's gonna slow down really hard once people get to the 20s
it's manageable if you have groups
I'm convinced I'm not gonna have fun on campus because the gyms are gonna be too high lvld lol
Juan and I fucked up a bunch of high schoolers last night
and they are hella scared of our gyms
There's like way more people off campus who play here than on, it's silly
Van*
What then? Risk/reward analysis that shit man
Fuck they candy there's a pikachu in that can
But what if there's a white van and candy
just don't go to random lures at night in the middle of the ghetto
Lures is how you get robbed at gunpoint fam
lures at pokestops draw them in too
they are more common in areas with higher density of people/cellphones
So pokemon are more common at pokestops?
there are people that drive from Rochester and surrounding areas just to play on campus
Yeah its directly below a dam, which is doing its job (you're welcome nyc) so no water is flowing in that section haha
That is a fat dried up creek then
My job site is by a creek, which happens to be dried up atm
They don't take them through ingress anymore, you have to ask
;)
How were you playing while swimming?
email niantic, they help with adding stops and have
You just need to play ingress to create stops
Like look at dis shit
As someone who lives in a less densely populated area, I'm pretty disappointed in pokemon go's outreach. I demand equality for small town cats like me
oh shit whaddup

Exactly Justin you need to open your eyes
Clocked out so...yes.
You did say you found it in a toolbag though 
Justin can you be a little shit somewhere else
Can't misplace a wallet if it's shoved up your bum hole
Nvm found it. It was in my toolbag
Tfw u lost your wallet 
There's that whole article that was fantastically written about Rits not so diverse campus 
Can confirm, Im doing phone stuff for faculty and staff like adding and removing from system
somethings up fam
I think every week, I hear about someone leaving RIT for a new job elsewhere
He invaded your safe space. Triggered
Kid with cerebral palsy just fell against the quiet study window in the library and I shot him the dirtiest look before I saw he had braces and a walker and shit. I'm going to hell

@A Pretty Straight Shooter likes his own messages and that is sad. 
^that XD
Unless their lats are as small as @Frock star 's. Then you know they never use the gym. 
If it's the opposite team you have to fight it to take it. if it's your team, you can fight it to make it stronger so other teams have a harder time taking it
can anybody use any gym 
Also if I'm not hard on my grand little then he won't toughen up enough to make me a great grand big 
I'm triggered
Max pls
Stop wasting my oxygen and kys. 
We all knew wards comment was hilarious. How did you contribute with your "^ that" comment. You didn't. That's how. 
^ that
No it's just helping him become the very best 
Is it hazing if we pick out a "Trainer Joey" pledge that has to take all of our phones on a one mile run every morning and catch every pokemon he sees? Asking for a friend. 
work on leveling up, we are gonna have level 20s on campus soon
Good start to the first day of work. Fire alarm in Gannett
Thx 4 help 
You do you fam, I'm working
Yo can we take the sundial. It'll be ez for me since I like like 20 steps away
It's settled then
Some of the pokestops are at reservable locations like Greek lawn and such
We can just start popping lures at events. People think they're for luring pokemon, but we can use them to lure frosh
New interview question for fall
Red team 4 lyfe
The only pokemon he knew was Pikachu and he kept emailing me asking if I caught one. so there we go
Lmfao Eric pope... why
 Got what I wanted out of this weekend
So many lures. I want it
That's when we can actually take the fucking gyms
Red seems to dominate in the morning
None
4 stacked gym
Blessed 
For red team
We have the sentinel 
Team not looking too bad for not having much Pokemon around me 
I am red team
But are you red team
The gym by my house is guarded by a dragonite 
I got a Jolteon now it's lit 
8/10. Gave 8 because I have leg room
PSA: Amtrak is terrible 
This fucker took my gym, with a 2000 snorlax -_-
Same tho, they're not too bad. Just go out at night.
I get two or three a day easy
Chateau is legit rolling ghastlys
But that's nice, I just have ghastlys
I popped a lucky egg and did a shit ton of evolutions. Sped up 3 levels.
@Adam Centanni One step closer 
I left controlling 3 gyms back in NYC
Heads up boys, Instinct plans on taking our dear gym at Barnes and Noble
I've seen rit during the day be more dead
the campus has no business being this active on a Sunday night
Did you catch it
None
pls
Well it's not like they had guns to kill you with. What  else are they supposed to do? 
walked by two public safety officers playing pokemon go
Would have been better with an Ahmed as the pilot 
None
"Evening officer! Just catching me some pokemons"
A cop asked me what I was doing, and I just said I'm making a great catch
Don't blame you at all tho 
Lmfao that's hilarious 
Stopped in the middle of the highway for an aerodactyl and a growlithe last night.
Only the real men did
Shit son, i learned my typing skills on the streets of Azeroth
Did anyone else play this back in elementary school?
Didn't say uhm alot so that's a plus 
I honestly thought my interview was crap 
I'll buy you a cake <3
*shit
my interview was shut so I knew I wasn't getting it
tfw rejected
I'm cool with it. Hey, if this is helping me pay for college, shit I won't complain 
basically
Which is obvious. I'm looking at it as "hes Greek so he knows how Greeks do Greek things"
I put no preference lol
yeah, people come and go. But not many people choose to be Greek RAs
So im assuming they're still shifting RAs around before August 
I contacted my RC to get some work hours approved and hes like "keep an eye out for any potential moves to your assignment"
"Wahhhh my rocks. You have to kill @Jake or we'll cry more"
sounds like a dope job
I'm not worried about it to be honest 
Yeah it's not free when you have to babysit a bunch of geedy little sorority boys
Jk im actually pretty excited
"work"
Fine, I work for that debit 
also "free"
^
That's the kind of entitlement that is wrong with our generation
Like RIT pls hook me up
I don't pay for debit right now since I'm getting it for free next semester anyways 
Or
you don't really have anyone to teach you besides others students
I've told my students in orientation about it all the time
Why don't they teach you people about this stuff
OR you can just load debit right now. Or any time. 
Start off the semester with like 2300 something. So what 
I should contact RIT and be like, "can I start my meal plan early pls"
Go away ghost Taylor we all know you're successful. 
"Getting a PhD and getting married" 
Seriously. Where is he when we need him
rip Taylor
that's been a thing for years
@Wes Parker load about 600 bucks debit and add more when you need it. I mix tiger bucks and debit so I can buy beer on campus and still not pay taxes on my food 
Why use my debit card and pay for tax when I can transfer the same amount to my RIT food plan and avoid tax
Dollar to dollar transfer is great. 
^ you save so much money 
I keep one because debit isn't taxed. 
Cook your meals nerd
Then you need a meal plan per rit housing rules. 
Beat the system and don't do that if you're not gonna go on that plan 
I'm probably going to get one, even if I'm living off campus
If you're not, you can use whatever you want
I have to live in the dorms Max. Scholarships
If you're in the dorms it's required. 
Dorms*
It's a dollar to dollar transfer when you load up your food debit account 
Don't get a meal plan unless you live in the forms 2
Y not?
Technically you don't need to go with those plans 
Update that bios boi
I like your folder named motherboard shit
Looks like it
Here are my options
Did they remove 1300,900,400 plans?
Yea orange. 
Idk if they changed it. 
Year*
Pick whatever is 4k for the yesr
Hey y'all. Quick question. Is the name of "all debit food plan" the "orange option"?

Omg McGregor's is a gym. Thank God
And see if I can spoof longer than 30 minutes. 
I'm gonna try it with an xposed module since I have my device rooted 
Me and Luther grabbed this up, it's a problem

I chose red team. Gonna a train today
Nooo, blue
I'll be red team 
if you are gonna be around sure, go and reinforce the gyms so you can get shit
There's mad red gyms around me should I just buff up my Pokemon and chose red?
There's no telling what will be king come fall 
Hmmmm
yellow and blue are pretty active
red is least picked on campus
Jk I don't wanna be like BT
So yellow?
He's on red
None
This decision 
@Moderator Supreme 
Side note, my job at ITS is gonna be lit. All I do is walk around campus so I can knock off pokestops while working
its shocking that a leader of african descent would be involved in a simulation of kids fighting battles
So kawaii
Juan-chan
I see 3 people out my window playing 
That sundial is gonna be a slaughterfest with the freshies
so those were just carried over
ingress also told users to pick significant or religious locations
The campus I'm at is lit. My house is the gym, and i hit like 7 stops on a 10 minute walk
the gyms on campus are:slaughter, Gordon field hel, sentiel, sundial and csd
Global village sign is a pokestop?
There's a bunch of churches near my house and those are gyms 
I heard u send in photos 
And the sentinel is a gym
I think they chose common locations 
I figured 
the tiger statue is a pokestop
I would have chosen the tiger statues balls 
*older game
users had time to submit locations and some were carried over to this game
everything was based off of their older gamer, ingress
How do they pick where gyms are? My secluded house is a gym...
I'm a minority. Triggered 
how can obama Hope to catch em all when he cant even catch the people behind benghazi??
my only question is if he spends all his time in a gym then how come his biceps are so small
if theres one thing i know about minorities its that they love to lounge around and collect a paycheck from the government so obama fits the profile of a pokemon master
Loving these servers!!
@A Pretty Straight Shooter heard secret service has a p stacked pokedex homie
I still laugh that I can go outside and any given time I can find 2-3 people playing this
yeah, servers are still dying
I'll totally go fuck up obamas pokemon, if i could actually play this damn game
k
Juan gotta ask you something go on Facebook 
the white house is a gym

Ive seen them here twice but they are rare
God bless 
Also Chateau is apparently a squirtle zone @Moderator Supreme pls confirm
Fuck fuck fuck
Swooped that good good puff in Gosnell @Adam Centanni 
Motherfucker deserves to die
If they kill him under suspicious circumstances, it will make the whole police brutality situation that much more true to everyone watching. However, if it comes down to a shootout, they're going to shoot to kill
If he does surrender peacefully, they'll make sure he gets to jail. Its a public image thing
I'm not supporting the revenge that is coming their way from law enforcement and  the public but its naive to think its not coming. Especially because their acts are in response to police brutality. If the unhinged brutality exist like they claim it will he even ten fold. They'll resist and grab for piper spray, "refuse to eat" etc. 
Actively picking off officers from sniper vantage points and shooting them when they hid from gun firing. I'd be surprised if they even make it to a prison. The rest of their short lives will be awful to boot. 
it's wild out there boys
5 dead 7 injured 3 arrested
then scratch
I'm really itching to find a puff and a gengar
Fack
i got a 420 magmar step up
Got that 254 Oddish, come at me

Jesus Christ. Two officers shot at Dallas protest 
True
gg riley
jokes on you. we burning the woods for our house
Pokemon go is just a way for the globalists and spooks to stalk our lives. Good luck with ur tech bell collars u sheeples. I'll be hiding in the woods from the wolves 
Dad likes cops smh can't trust nobody
Yeah. Ingress is dope
pokemon go happened bc they teamed up with this already existing geolocator game. One of my old coworkers used to play it and she's hot af
good grief
Shots fired at protest in Dallas 
because im gonna be there this weekend
board yes, can't find the iron
side note, juan do you guys have an iron and ironing board?
before i leave
i might as well start taking night strolls here in NYC
this campus is gonna be a war zone in a month
and watch everyone get but hurt
gyms off campus is a good idea tho
and then sweep blue gyms at night
train there and bulk up
oh jeez, that's extreme
have a gym off campus
schedule 12AM-2AM hunts
so heres what we do....
I can only carry so hard
I took two but Merriman took one back.
before these freshies come through with yellow
whoever is red team better farm up this summer quick and snag them gyms
I tried playing it for about 2 min was p dumb 
just low key tho
so we take red team to new heights?
blue is taking over
the campus barely has red, pls
b's up boi
so we joining red team

I remember the days of 2 ethnicities like if ur a 90s baby

Juan you will never out obsess merriman.

That movie is going to give me cancer 
They always base it off one and the nickname is a damn good way to target without getting sued imo
nice job director
except for the fact that the shorten way of calling them applies to a couple of other groups
Just the nickname I mean
I mean, they picked an organization that doesn't exist
Pretty sure someone will die in the movie 
Wonder how the phi Sig's are gonna feel lol
I'm curious to people's reactions. The plot is pretty predictable due to what it is, unless someone dies
Same with ward
Part of me wants to see it but the other part doesn't want to give them a penny
First time in a while I've seen a frat movie that wasn't at least comical
Ez pz lemon squeezy
"I bet you haze"
"Orly you wanna bet money?"
"Ya sure"
"K become a pledge then"
Comes out at the end of September, definitely very targeted. Intense hazing does happen and everybody knows it but the trick is convincing people that it doesn't happen with us.
eh, I guess
I agree with the piece, it's stuff that happens but the movie exagerates it to make it everyone
Gg frats. 
Welp
Wtf. Check TFM there's a recent article about a movie coming out

Bonus hint: apply today and get an iPhone and a Cadillac. 
BEST hint: apply for welfare
BETTER hint: spray the paint directly into a sock and suck in hard next to the sock. Less paint on your nose 
I've used spray paint for work before in a inside trailer bay. Basically a giant indoor garage  and was okay. Just gotta use bursts. 5 seconds on then let the dust settle. Gets less runny that way too. 
Better hint: do work that let's you sit safely behind a desk in an air conditioned office. 
Helpful hint 
I'm saying this because it happened to a friend of mine 
When spray painting metal beams at work, wear a respirator or mask. Otherwise you run the risk of getting lightheaded and potentially high at work

its you're boi changed the topic to: bicep isolation
I have a td ameritrade account that I use 
Are you doing it through a company? I've always wanted to mess with stocks
Source- I'm doing just that in 3-4 days 
Theres always risk. I would side moreso with international british firms then straight brit  
Would there be much risk involved? It seems like all the big companies would surely climb back up
Nah, about a week from now is though. Have to wait for them to bottom out 
Is now a good time to invest in UK stocks? 
From an economical standpoint..teams in UK (for this transfer season) will have to shell out more pounds ( because of the drop) long term wise...it promotes British youth development..but it kind of forces these teams to be a buying club versus a team who develops their youth..in order to compete with EU teams that sign the next generation of soccer stars before UK can
True that makes sense. I didn't realize soccer was apart of EU agreements. That really blows for the players and teams a like 
When you're trying to recruit the "next messi" and potentially gain a profit..yeah 
Is that a lot of time in terms of soccer? 
@Grant Scheynost teams in UK can't grab 16year olds...gotta wait an extra 2 years..2years to get snatched by teams in EU
Srry for the blocks of text. This is a few beers and a fire pit conversation not a spam the groupeme with your opinions in novel form topic. 
But that copa america final dis weekend doe
That's the point lmao 
Nobody watches baseball lol
So how bout them Yankees?
Could be a NAFTA like agreement. I'm not sure. Issues that arise instead the UK (Irish + Scots) could definitely be as bad as you say Justin. That would be when the world starts burning as Juan put it lol
Gonna fuck the Premier league @Justin E ...payet and Martial would have never been eligible 
They could still stay part of the single market economy, which would mean that the tariffs and visas wouldn't happen
That's very true. I think the scope of my logic/argument is that tariffs are not as a big deal and aren't as scary as they sound and they will save the next bail out. As well as the issues that arise with a centralized currency among many nations. They can not make decisions like the Fed can and with a German controlled euro board it makes it harder for struggling nations to get head above water(could write more on this but its too long for groupme) . I would look more to the next country to leave   
A lot of the things you're talking about Justin depend on the negotiations the UK makes with the EU
^dont know by how much but logically it will
If Scotland and NOrthern Ireland (who wanted to stay) get their favorable referendum..that'll screw with UK economy further 
No clue don't know the quantitative impact on the economy..but now it's a thing (was reading on its impact on European soccer)
What percentage of their workers did that? I'm now familiar with those numbers 
now that they aren't EU their workers would require a visa to work in an EU country now
We're talking about the former ruler of the seas and trade here. They are not a third world nation and comparing them to the rest of Europe right now they have average/strong futures. What this will do I think will force them to have stronger relationships with the U.S and Asia which isn't the worst case. The germans have already called for a weird free trade pac with the UK because they realize the net loss by cutting them out like a bad ex girlfriend. 
But they're still a large economic contributer, and if you examine tariff history, it usually causes that country to sell and trade with other nations, which would probably hurt the EU more economically
Can't you argue that not being a part of the EU = hit with them juicy tariffs?
shh, I'm watching the world burn. Don't look to the future
Not at all. This is good for Britain long term and the turmoil now will bring in foreign investors. You have to think bigger picture it may not immediately save 350M but how much will it save over the course of 3,5,10 years? It's speculation either direction but I think it's naive to right off this decision now after it only happened a few hours ago. 
He fucked up and fucked UK up 
Cause he called for the referendum thinking they'd vote to stay
and the prime minister peaced out
yeah
Didn't the campaign also promise to save 350m for something only to say jk the day of the result?

"...designed for military use."  And who was this weapon designed for? 
I'm all for my guns, but the AR-15 is most definitely an assault rifle. They can even be modified to meet your definition with the right tools.
Same could be said with any magazine fed semi...theoretically you could hair trigger all of these guns ...doesn't make them assault rifles
That's the Wikipedia definition.. Everywhere else just says it needs to be magazine fed and have the ability to shoot in rapid succession. I'm sure I can unload a clip in a few seconds
do you need a select fire switch on your fists to be charged with assault and battery?
That's a quality shitpost there 
http://www.barstoolsports.com/dmv/man-celebrates-the-cavs-title-by-eating-fresh-poop-right-off-the-street-not-safe-for-eyes/
The definition of an assault rifle is the ability to switch fire modes ..the Armalite rifle - 15 is only semi
So why aren't they assault rifles?

I'm talking about the fobby ones tho.. There's a difference, one likes rap the other bongo music
Africansare the best if you want that Cesar tho
Update: africaans are no good either 
WHEN ALL I WANTED WAS A BEIBER CUT
Shit was trauamatic, he put mousse in my hair
Lmao i got fucked up in middle school by an asian guy too
#summer2k16thoughts
The Asians here suck ass at cutting hair, should definitely stick with nails. Don't think race has to do with it I think it's how fobby they are. Is it racist: the jury is out
POLL: Do you let people of other races cut your hair or nah? Does it make you racist if you dont?

So everyone came back to the city lol 
I guess I'm fortunate in it being my first college summer 
That sucks 
Who tryna head up July 1st?
I can only spend so many days in a row with the 2 guys that actually came home lol
Pretty happy tbh, but I do find myself thinking about RIT from time to time 
Spending a lot of time with my close friends from back home 
Bored out of my mind
How's summer anyone else ready to go back yet
Oldie but a goodie

"Who the fuck do you know here"
Gay friends or bfs*
@Abid Raja 
Btw I probably know the most phi taus here, 5+ lol but well enough that I have a feel for them. They're fairly fratty dudes but they don't let other guys, not even gay, to their parties. Their 50 year shirts said something along the lines of don't know how we're still here. I wouldn't agree with all their practices but they can be cool guys

Missed out on moving to jersey 
Housing bubble crash = buying foreclosed properties = win
Missed out homie...
RIP Hopes and dreams of moving 
Ended up putting a bid for a house in jersey, got outbid
Too many things happen in my area. Surprised my parents haven't moved out yet. 
Craziest thing to happen here was once a kid got high and tried to go home but was too high to figure out he was in the wrong neighborhood.. After trying like 6 houses to see if they were his one guy got fed up and brought a gun into the mix. The kids in jail now 
^perfect crime
Shit in a bag, ring the doorbell, and light the bag fire. 
Shoot at it with a crossbow
Alright alright...use the object you use to unlock things with...and scratch around the car

I was in the locker room and this man with headphones was yelling Antidote

The phi taus I have met are chill ..idk what their fraternity does on campus tho
I've only hung out with a few and not enough to really get any ideas about their organization 
What are Phi Tau brothers like 
Make sure your tat dances boi
I don't go to weenie hut jr u heard 
There was a reddit thread awhile back where one shit talked us. Called us goobers. Thats the worst thing to call a man 
Except when some butt hurt phi tau rates us saying we shit talk other fraternities to make ourselves look better
Doesn't make a difference if it's one of us or not. The truth is the truth. 
People still look at it tho if rankings are still being posted
That website is a joke all the good rankings are fake and the rest are just bashing on people
If it's not one us..someone seems to be trying to start shit
the KDR ratings are hella brutal.
I'm just hoping it wasn't one of us
Greek rank is literally just a bash fest...literally keyboard warriors. The sorority rankings are even more visual aids.
Same person who posted that posted on phi tau that they haze
wasnt aware derby days is just sigma chi and ASA.
Yo but who's posting on Greek rank at 6:30am pretty sure phi tau is pissed

You shouldn't be able to. Last time I checked, if you leave a group yourself and aren't kicked, you have to do some shit online to get back in
I'm the group creator and I couldnt add him. He pops up then it I hit invite and it doesnt go through. I doubt you can Alejandro 
God dammit Justin 
I didn't, but I can
Rip
I can add him back 
What he doesn't know is that it's significantly more difficult to get back into group chats when you leave yourself instead of getting kicked. We won't be able to add him back in. 
Justin E has left the group.

You gotta say senpai instead 
Follow up question, how do you not blush and shout "kawaii" at a m'lady after you wave. Been giving me trouble 
I've had a few 20/80 experiences
True
She can go negative percent in this situation 
But
And Benabe that's not even logically possible because if I go 100 percent then it always results in a kiss
Mote of a 70/30 guy
When you go for the kiss you go 90 percent of the way and wait for the girl to come the other 10
What's the rule? 
But your turn outs are still 0
You guys remember that 90/10 rule from hitch? Do guys actually do that? I just go 100

I see I got downgraded to 3. It's a good day! 
I was actually pretty curious who number 2 on your shit list is, so i appreciate that Luther
That's one of her senior projects btw
As I've been told, many times
#2 on my shit list, if anyone is curious 
She does this shit all the time. She did it with the transgender article awhile back, and she did it with the public safety stuff 
She's not strongest writer and makes some allegations with out clearly labeling them as such. I say allegations because I'm not informed on any of the cases cited, she never says an wrong and doing was found and name dropped pretty frequently. Hopefully, RIT protects her journalism but at the same time I can see repercussions to this.

Mods are in essence what is wrong with the capitalist swine and the oligarchs of this country. If and when the people rise up I, the chairman of the workers party of Korea will lead this chat to prosperity. For starters, the likes are not equally distributed. A select few users covet all of the likes while others starve away into the nothingness of being under appreciated. Also, the muted users are not represented in the memes that give life blood to this chat. We will stand for this no more. Rise up my brothers in arms! Take back the day! Viva La revolution! The blood of the bourgeoisie will be seen and the iron of the proletariat will sing with the freedom of a thousand suns.

Yeah but how much of U of R research funding goes to on campus preventive measures like "how can we lower the syphilis epidemic on campus?" And "how can we lower the numbers of alcohol poisonings per weekend?" Or my own personal favorite "how do we get the student body to stop drinking out of the river like its a giant water fountain?"  
However you can only count it once if it's unpaid 
Well, more situations to encourage students to do more of it
They do count 
I've also heard about making research couting as coops in some situations so they are really trying to enourage more of it 
In our defense, u of r kicks ass in the medical field
Bruh
^just to show how little we focus on research 
Research based means we can actually start trying to be the next Car mellon like they preached on all of our freshman years from the beginning of time 
Ohhhhhh btw so we net around 5 million in NIH funding while u of r has over 1 billion in funding 
Yes, and more graduate/undergraduate research
Yeah 
So bigger graduate programs?
With the strategic plan, it will be in the coming years
Rit was not research or PhD focused before
And it's moving towards that even more than it already is?
Selling the air of Destler's last connvocation. $1000 starting bid
^ the math checks out. I just made a spread sheet real fast 
If RIT trends towards research and PhDs then the prestige of an RIT diploma will increase 
It's gonna be one of those ultra rare Destler-issued diplomas. It'll be worth tens of dollars
How?
At least our diploma value will go up significantly 
I think I might have a 6th sense and I'm really fucking weirded out. My professor has not canceled class more then once before today. I woke up this morning thinking "I should check my email what if she canceled class and I drive there for nothing". Low and behold I check and she canceled class. Wtf. 
However things start to change, I was fortunate enough to be here while destler was pres
The focus is definitely going towards research, and imagine RIT lends itself to that though 
It was talked about alot in my various work circles. They wouldn't be dumb enough to drop it but focus might change
Hell no, imagine RIT brings in too much business for then to cut it now 
That's what I'm afraid of. Imagine RIT might also be in jeopardy since it was destler's baby but I don't think they'll give it up
There's gonna be changes coming in the future. I think I know who his replacement will be, and rumor is he's not as student centric as Destler 
Yeah it's been on the books for awhile 
It was gonna happen
There we go it's offical

shave your pits
I feel like raising money to shave your head is kinda bad since it's supposed to be a symbol of support/respect
You're so generous Luther 
@A Pretty Straight Shooter  shave your head
But I'll wax it
I dunno a out buy the wax 
I will 
gladly
Ill do that too ^
Luther, if i get 50 dollars will you buy the wax and do my knee down?
nah raise 200 dollars each, shave your head
Kid compared crew to fraternities
Like 200 dollars total between us?
200 dollars we shave each others heads
I'll do a leg for free
Good thing between the cheeks is only 15
Jesus, 50 for half a leg
I need to see how much waxing costs
Do it
Your*
Make it more than 40 youre legs are valuable
Ay it's cool with me
Watch out for brothers donating
Unless they actually pay 40 and i have to wax 
I feel like the chances for this are slim, but it doesn't hurt
Do it
Wax it for 40?
Like can i say I'll shave one of my legs for 15 dollars?

Girls have cooties so thats probably the correct move Charles

I love tipping my fedora 
Jake you should've hyped them by tipping your fedora to them as they walk past you
Our goal is to make it more fun every year so they care and we have a better chance of donations and hype for our big event
You gotta realize at least half of some sororities couldn't care any less about derby days 
They probably don't care
Had class with a sister from every organization. Didn't notice me because I sit in the front and they don't know who "Benabe 82" is
Skip all your classes and huff paint and a locked room

I don't  think I've felt uncomfortable in any chapter house until I came to phi tau
Yeah that was a stat i was interested in
Not many other organizations can say that
You can look up some facts but 100% of donations go directly to cancer research would be the biggest charm point
I was thinking about what to post on facebook and just was wondering what was good about huntsman
I was curious for derby days since that's our biggest fundraiser, we're kind of making it our most important
Founded by sigs, good charity, etc
In what context? Derby  days goes to huntsman but everyone of our other events have been for many other groups
Why do we donate to Huntsman over other places?
And we didn't have our derby days total included. I don't understand
They do polar plunge

I learned from the first scuffing of nipples to wear an undershirt
I've always considered shaving and wearing clothes I never wear for derby days
My nipples are killing me

They don't know anything man
I'm bored already

If amar don't like turtles I can't support a turtle h8r
Totally.
They better like turtles

What's the number and percentage of greek life here?
Sigma chi SG takeover bruh 
Right, having 8k+ greeks who have a strong influence  on everything that goes on will do that to you
Like there and ole miss it's kinda like you have to do greek if you want to be someone, here it's just extra
It's cool that greek is so important there but i wouldn't like feeling pressured into greek
They  have an interesting campus and Greek system
 Any geeds want to carpool wit me 
Not really 
If that's relevant at all
Alabama had a terrible feel for me when i visited
It also spends a great deal discussing the university of Alabama and how much influence  Greeks have. Everything from their coucils having alot of power to an organization know as "tell machine" that helps them control some aspects of the school. Political or otherwise

You do smoke opium but poppy tea is made by mainly high schoolers and those with out access to opiates. Its made by buying bulk poppy seads online for "art" then you cook a batch with like a pound or two of seeds. Its dangerous tho because its either a light buzz or theres enough residue opium that ya OD. No way to assess "tolerance" because every batch is different 
Pls and ty 
As a chinaman I ask you to fuck off my opium 
You don't smoke the ope? 
Hella people die from poppy tea. Unregulated and always changing amount of opium water in each glass. Very sketchy  
I heard eating spoonfuls of poppy seeds r good for studying. 
I also hear biker crank is a good way to boost energy and cognitive functioning.

Juan you can message me. 
If I had the money id probably still do it. Again, going solely based on what I know of housing .
If people want to reach out and want to talk, I can
If we had chapter, I'd be able to explain more but it will have to wait
Discouraged mainly because I wanted to avoid paying an arm and a leg again. 
Because I know I'd be discouraged 
Of course it would but as I stated above, I would have been more clueless back then
So it would be a contributing factor to pledge ship in your opinion? 
And when I was pledging, I don't  know what I know now about the houses
If I was forced to live in a place that is more expensive, more restrictive and with a roommate. I'd be discouraged  but it's not a negative
Or debate. Whatever you wanna call it. 
I do not know as much as you Juan but the amount I do know will make me with out a doubt or flinch  vote no if comes up. 
I'm curious, not actually getting into an argument. 
And if that were the case, would you still have pledged knowing it was a requirement to live in the house? 
That is false
Juan I'm pretty sure this has been discussed every semester since I became a brother.....
Or would you still be upset that you have to live in the dorms for one more year. 
If we had one prior to us coming to RIT and it was a requirement, would you really view it in terms of it being negative
I will explain, I just wanted discussion to start
Defense of what
Is there an opening or something? Just curious how this got brought up
I feel like we're on the defense since we actually don't own a dedicated floor/mansion 
You will have to make it a requirement or something because the penalties of no filling rooms will make us bankrupt
Everyone but the president's room
It's not fair to older brothers at all. 
Don't you share rooms in the mansion?
Let's say this happens. And we get it. If you're required to live in the dorms and move from riverrun to the dorms, then 100% I'm against that
A "mansion" is a better deal but I still don't want one
I can write an essay on this but I just hate the idea
Why would I pay more money to have a roommate? Wheres the incentive. Dorms are a little more then double what I will be paying per month next year and I get my own room
*great
I love Josh and we are on reat terms but I hate sharing a room
You  get to a point where you don't  want them if you can avoid it
At least we can hang stuff in the hallway? Ya?
But that's just me. I just have problems with my roommates not cleaning up the living room. Other than that, I'm content
The whole thing about "meh I have to share a room" is pretty lame honestly. I've dealt with having a roommate for almost 3 years. It's not even that bad, especially when you know your roommates habits and stuff. Being a brother, I feel it's a little more open in terms of expectations from one another. The whole bathroom situation, I guess it's a small point but you shitting with the same seat as your parents for god knows how long. 
Teach me Senpai
 But again, I know too much
I will never ever want a house a campus, dorm or mansion
But one fuck up is all it takes I guess 
I think dorms are getting a bad rap. They're as useful, if not as pretty, as a Greek mansion and are easier to fill. You're not gonna party in either
I would be fine with dorms
I'll  explain more at some point
Kind of funny to see the people who know nothing about how those dorms work are more likely  for them.
Ez slip n slide 
Yes for dorms 
I mean, sure I would like to since I am applying for the ra position, however, I understand that it's a pain. So, I would vote no
Good point^ campo and res life is chill for me but they're probably so strict on greek dorms
One beer found anywhere could be awful news for the chapter its a fucking liability. 
Dorm houses suck. Always having randos walking through your area always having campo breathing down your neck and searching your shit. I would 150% never live in one

No. I'd be forced to ride a longboard to class

No.

Serious question, if we could get a dorm as a chapter house, would the chapter  want it?

But this also isn't the right forum to discuss this me thinks
I would say our campus does a damn good job with power usage 
40% is clearly an exageration. But theres a lot of uneeded overhead. Un-optimized device and power use. Administration has proven to over value the income of their new projects and investments, while underestimating the expenditures
This is why we refrain from teaching Riley Cantonese

Oh he didn't do that to charles
But the way he approaches women is just  odd and he's known to do this
He does alot of good work for the community and I'm decent friends with him
Yeah, it's no joke
That upsets me that he won greek man of the year then, that's so disrespectful to girls imo. I get where he's coming from if it's a joke kind of, but if he's making a serious attempt then that just shows no understanding of women
Yeah, he's  a bit notorious for that

I'm extremely mad because this was the year
give the amount of time in the future, im more than sure we can do it.
Think about this, we're going on 5 Years and we're already a growing chapter with a large presence with tons of brothers contributing back to the RIT community instead of just wearing letters and calling it a day
I should play video games
I'm incredibly  heated about this
ahh okay
They happen once a year with nominations, usually from chapter presidents and whatever is submitted in the end of the year report
pls responderino. would like us to see get more achievements for our work across campus.
also, how does one aim for being nominated for greek award?
mbmb
Could be worse...could've been rappa kelta dho
Regardless congrats on them. I don't know what else they do but it must have been other things we might have just overlooked. Idk
Apologize if it sounded like bad mouthing. This is just my general opinion 
My fault. Didn't mean that. It's not justified to count philanthropy as that
Sorry, terrible wording 
Careful Jake...you're calling out  3/4 of Greek life here
At the end of the day JC knows we do real community service and thats all that matters #blessed 
I wouldn't  want to start bad mouthing. The system itself is also flawed since it allows then to do so and many other organizations 
IMO. Community service should strictly be doing things on your off time. Not for a planned organized event amongst your chapter 
You must be that low to count a philanthropy as community service 
Really?

You could cash your check, for a fee, at western union or any similar place. It will probably be sketchy 
And then you got money! Intimidation and idle threats always work
Sometimes if you threaten  your check by holding a lighter or flame so close they almost touch (like you would a knife to someone's skin), it will start to sweat the cash inside of it
To deposit it, your bank may have an online method where you send a picture of the front and back through your account on their website and it goes into your account
The cheapest way to cash the check would be to see if your bank has a bank app that you can deposit checks with(taking picture) then just get cash back at grocery stores ($60 each trip)
But to cash it, you can go to cashmycheck.com, put your check in the usb port and money comes out your cd reader
Oops, deposit is what i meant more than cash
Thought you meant deposit to your bank 
Oh nvm I misread 
Just google how to cash a check online? Or is it specific for rit?

I don't think it's my perception though. I think he's actually starting to have a weaker stage presence. Rubio as well he started so strong as the poster boy of GOP establishment but the "Obama knows exactly what he did" fuck up really lowered his confidence 
Is it because it's a bit of a reality now that he might get nominated?
Trump is getting less and less charismatic(Not agreeing with him but he does have a lot of charm). He's starting to seem
more and more flustered and nervous. When backed into a corner he sloppily manages to sneak out of it.

I feel pretty fucking cheated...of all of the Greek organizations ..which actually follows the rules
People don't follow it and the ofsl isn't  strict enough. I've brought that up to them before
Shouldn't ofsl set a more specific definition of service hours?
Or involving in an event where your organization is not an affiliated party?
Should be
Shouldn't community service be hours that you give voluntarily without any gain towards your organization
That too
People count relay as hours too 
Phi psi counts mud tag as service hours and they rake in thousands
Would that explain why pi kap has 1000 hours a semester?
Just overhearing people and saying what I've seen in the ofsl
People counting other organizations event attendance as service, people couting running their own event as service, coverting dollars to hours. 
Huh? 
What do you mean
This actually makes me mad
The way people count philanthropy and community service is hella fucked

I kind of hate people who aren't cool with their sounds being used. All it does is bring more attention/interest to their stuff again
That's even more lame than kanye since their song is old as hell
It was on frank oceans mixtape which was released for free but te eagles bitched even though he wouldn't be profiting directly from that sample
What happened? I just youtubed that and found it i think, it's sweet
Everyone does that...(fuck you eagles for removing frank oceans "American wedding")
Nah fuck kanye. Apparently someone made a fire mix of him and death cab for cutie, "Death Cab For Yeezie", and he removed it from the internet

*sigh*...
You daddy issues sloot
Shut up and strip
Every hero is born from a reason
^ This is why Bathroom Pioneer was needed
Yeah but I can sneak into the basement bathroom without anyone seeing me enter and exit 
Bathroom on Campus center basement is decent as well. A lot of privacy and its clean 
Or 4th floor
I always take shits in the basement of institute...so much privacy 
The light seriously won't turn on :(
It's on campus, 2 ply TP is like finding the fountain of youth
Those bathrooms are literally the best
Thats an...interesting hobby, Mr. "Bathroom Pioneer" 
You're literally the worse
OH SHIT UPDATE: Motion sensor light is very hard to reactivate while sitting. Overall rating now 5/10
No mention of the ply of toilet paper
You're welcome, brothers.
Bathroom Pioneer, over and out
Feb. 23, 2016
Location: Basement of Institute Hall
Traffic: Very light use, floor and toilet are nicely clean
General Atmosphere: Pale grey tiles and white walls lead to a mostly emotionless experience.
Flush Capability: Strong
Toilet Paper Placement: NOTE - Toilet paper roll is placed in awkward, convenient angle. Subtracts highly from pleasure.
Overall Rating: 6/10 because of toilet paper placement.

But not in the beginning. With a billion dollars and a can do spirit anything is possible 
Yeah but isn't it for your kids or someone else.. Like you have ultimate access and you're supposed to release it more as you trust they won't blow it

Build a frat mansion over the Alfred avenue and build a zip line that goes directly to RIT. Ian have brilliant ideas
I donate to RIT so I can have a building but name it something silly
Or buy us all tickets for the spring break cruise
Fuck those nf geeds I'll have a frat house if I want

Same with buying a house on land. Property tax is fucking insane 
And fuck living in NYC
Justin can have one of those lambos 
*land
Even so, I'm a simple man with modest tastes. And NYC is a bias example
Park ave yo. Straight up 100 million dollar apartments with indoor swimming pools bigger than suburban houses 
You could drop 10M on a Manhattan apartment. You'll be paying a lot 
20 rolls
Bitches always need hand
Does Justin get one of those lambos?
Invest in land
75 rarries
Tons of football players spend too big and when they get hurt for good they go from millions to workin at wegmans 
I want 80 lambos

Juan you are from the city million dollar houses aren't that huge
Because they don't think of their futures 
Jk 
Fuck kids. My money 
Nor all those cars
Invest in businesses 
I will never buy a house for a million
There are a decent amount of documentarys on winners who had lives destroyed
For your future kids
Invest for the future
Doesn't happen in one day, but a house will put you back a few million, cars a few hundred thousand, school a few hundred thousand then what
Yea what would you do with that? I couldn't possibly see myself wasting over 500M in my life 
If scumbags figure out who wins they will straight up kidnap family members plus you get an influx of sob story letters every day, everyone you've ever met wants money and frivolous lawsuits spring up like mushrooms in wet soil. Fuck that. Winning the lottery sounds like a curse 
That's not enough you've literally got hundreds of millions dude 
After that, family, house, debt, 
After a couple thousand, the average person will be overwhelmed
You could easily drop 200k for petty shit for yourself. 
I mean you have to spoil yourself a little... 
If you go to BJs they should sell money in bulk. Get it on sale. I have a few coupons ready 
Just saying, having that much on hand makes people go nuts
It's like a cash grocery store
Banks sell money 
Get it in bulk
Invest more Juan 
Winning the lottery is dangerous. Don't tell anyone, get a lawyer from
Across the country with no ties to you, claim it with a multi-national firm. 
Mo cash money. But more money duh
Mo bitches
Mo bitches ward tf you mean
Like what in the fuck will you use 930 million for
And destroy themselves
But some lottery winners literally don't don't know how to handle that much money
Mo money mo problems
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
It'll last a few generations
Dammit I daydreamed again
I WON THE LOTERY!!!! 
930 million is still 930 million, you wouldn't really complain about it
Sig fig newtons
Lol lotteries
Nah depends on the sig figs
ITS TIME TO CHECK 
Lol
So 500,000,001 is still a billion 
Yea my teacher told me if it's more than 50% then it's rounded up

A brazzers account would save me from so many poor sexual risks is why i said risk manager
Can we use dues for a brothers brazzer account?
Amendment: kustos because he handles sacred materials
I move for risk manager to be in charge of getting a brazzers sign in for the chapter
You get lost very quickly, and it says something when you actually consider buying porn from a site

Nice going
I almost set the alarm off in Perkins 
Lmao I actually believe it was called Frindr I was about to look it up
Hahaha
Oh wait, the name is grindr! But yeah dude
I think you mightve messed up the first letter
A lot of them are really friendly and message you first too
Yeah, you go on there and you can just talk to a ton of bros
You're fucking kidding 
It's called frindr or something
Oh dude, they have that already i think!
I love it 
Frat tinder lol
Thats cute. You guys just bond over groupme before you meet in person. This is like frat tinder
I KNEW IT 
He's pretty cool tho, so it's k
We actually made charles up
It's cool though we'll hang out when in like a week 
Mhm. I remember the dinner but not meeting you 
We didn't really talk tho
We met at that turkey recruitment dinner 
But I feel like I've never actually shaken your hand before 
@Charles Hem Have I actually Ever met you in person... If I did I'm sorry and I'm just blanking, 
Ain't nothin wrong with a lil self like, just wankin for your ego's all. Ain't nothin wrong with that
Own it brother
It was an accident 
I saw that too lol @Charles Hem 
I'll be done with tinder once and for all once I get back and actually meet girls from the area again 
Lol at the self like ward
Nah and that's even more teasing than tinder
More teasing even if you get nudes
Teasing myself is better than look at fat dudes in their 50's all day
Nudes
I only do the 10 a month. 
It's just like teasing yourself though
Holy smokes. That shit is 55 for a year. I always thought tinder+ was like a one time 5 dollar paid app
My cousin has it too, he was face timing a girl in Paris 
Plus I was bored at work, so stare at a wall, check Facebook four times in twenty minutes, or talk tools from around the globe 
Its a cheap investment for a dude on coop
I didn't like having only 100 matches a day either 
(But it is worth it)
Because I was insanely bored at work for 7 months. I only have it for like another week or two before the subscription runs out. Won't but it again. 
Maybe he doesnt like the 12 hour cap? 
Why though? The only thing I could see is if you're going to be visiting a place for a little bit, you could swipe there beforehand and talk to a girl and then meet up once you get there 
In LA right now 
I actually do
Hahah do you actually have tinder plus?
Maybe. But probably now 
Tinder plus man gotta do it 
All that happens is you match with hot girls who you know you'll never get to see, but I still do it every time I get bored
Awww damn. You think you'll keep talking to her? I was swiping at my brother's house 3 hours away from my house and I have no clue why
She's from Minnesota and leaving in the morning 😔
Guaranteed more matches 
Put a picture of a puppy up 
You totally gotta bring me on one of y'alls dates now dude
@Jim Gordon 
@Jim Gordon Use the line. It's good luck 
Oh noiceee
The babeology 
Or which line
I'm ragin for some asian?
Thanks to @Charles Hem line 
I'm talking to a pretty hot Asian girl 
>woah this is a cool feature, wonder what it's for
>nice dude
>That feel when you've had 9 matches in the last week after not using the app for 2 months 
Lol they're fucked actually bama is gonna score again
1 timeout now...if it's a td their chance becomes slim to none
Clemson has a chance...... As much as I hate to say it 2 time outs 2 minutes left
4/6 timeouts used because bama players don't know how to lineup lol..
Bama been doing great with all of the play callings 
Holy. Fuck.
My mom...in the most innocent way..likened the Clemson player pounding his chest to a chimp
Clemson still lined up as if they were going to spike with12 seconds left so..I would say Clemson also fucked up
Wow the refs fucked that up
Bcs bowl buddy

You don't see a super like unless you match

   One day we'll travel back in time 
Gosh read a book dude...
Uhhh have you not seen Hot Tub Time Machine or Back to the Future? 
I do not smile upon such defeatist talk, comrade Ariel 
But the whole thing is bunk since there is no theoretical way to travel backwards in time.
Grandfather Paradox, for all you lay people
One of many paradoxes 
If you went back in time to kill hitler to prevent the holocaust, the holocaust would never happen, therefore you would never go back in time to kill him. 
You didn't tag him tho 
"I can do it better" -Crawford 
You heard it here first guys Matt Crawford wants to kill Hitler replace him and do a better job
And probably tortured first
You would be executed 
Prison? 
Stalin is offended
I wouldn't do it because I'm selfish and wouldn't want to spend life in prison afterwards 
Yeah but it can't get much worse than hitler, I'd take my chances 
Butterfly effect man
Have you not learned anything from television Matt? Never alter the past 
So uh you guys were kidding about the world war 2 needing to happen and not killing hitler if you could, right?
Shotgunned in the korean karaoke bar haha
Probs*
I pros woldnt do it tho
Yeah decent point, maybe Hitler killed Super Hitler somewhere along the lines. But the flip side is that he killed awesome people too 
I was just thinking about that Juan. In a sense, even though how horrible the holocaust was, in a sense, it still needed to happen. Same thing with World War II 
Who's knows what evil Hitler prevented. Don't mess up history fam
Can I say that I'm from the future or does that cause a riff in the space time continuum?
No chance lance 
If you could go back in time and kill baby Hitler but you have to stay in that time and face the consequences, would you?
That sir..is a generalization. A good example is "all Jews are greedy"
 "Justin E has mentioned you in 'The Roast of Guy "Pat" Fieri" might as well say "Justin E has accused you of being a Nazi", once I see your name I know it's coming 
I guess changing it to Fieri would be akin to yearning for persecution
ye
K is the show?
@Matthew Crawford  Changed his last name to avoid persecution as well. It was Himmler
The plot just gets really dumb and I'm picky
watch K. its on netflix. excellent show.
I won't spoil but there's still a lot of action and crazy moments
Yeah i can see the story getting worse. It seems like it'll turn into a conspiracy/mystery show and I'm not into it
then shed be XXXXX guy-fieri
Max please. Hyphens are for the birds
marry a feminist with the last name guy
assuming someone would take his name
Your wife and kids will be ridiculed for life
No don't do that 
My family changed their name from furey to furrey to avoid persecution after coming over from Ireland. I think today was a sign that I need to change it to Fieri
Season 1 was the height for me, after that it gets worse story wise. It'll still be exciting for some folk

But a mike steak combo comes 5x more mussels than a pat platter... So the ratio is probably leaning towards pat platter being fatter 
Although I'm pretty sure mike steaks have a higher fat content
Flames never die out when roasting a pat steak. All the fat comes off and starts a grease fire 
Juan Lachapelle changed the group's name to The Roast Of Guy "Pat" Fieri

Can I order a pat platter with mussels? 

I'm sorry sir we've never offered a pat platter with mussels 

*rubs chin* 
I'm not surprised 
My Pat steak was a little to fatty for me 
I didn't realize how good Charles could be even with the Guy Fieri mandate
I'll have my steak cooked Pat muscle, please

"Excuse me, what sir?"

*puts sunglasses on* 
Rare
14 lbs of mussels would be amazing, not that pat would know 
I didn't realize the grilled Pat breast would be this small when I ordered it...
I ordered noodles to go on my plate Pat, not to be attached to your shoulders
Al dente pasta can bench more than you can
If I come back and this is the best that's done I'm gonna be dissapointed

That's true. I definitely felt like I came out of there having watched Pocahontas: The Next Generation
Lol nah I'm not the fan base I just appreciate the technical shit. The only reason I know is because I went on a "behind the scenes" tour the last time I went to Disney and they told us what the giant metal cage is. No joke looked like a sports stadium 
I think it was more popular due to its technical prowess and effects rather than story/characters
Actually? 
Apparently Riley is the fanbase
Insider information: Disney is making a massive Avatar mini park in Walt Disney Worlds: Animal Kingdom Park 
When's the last time you saw a blue native american (avatar) cosplay?
Yea I was only talking from the movie/producer stand point 
Yeah but usually something so popular gets a fan base
I think I read somewhere that the movie wasn't supposed to be as big of a hit as it was. So they had no initial plans to do a sequel 
Well they're making an avatar 2
What does that even mean
Speaking of Avatar tho, I just read something about how strange it was that it grossed like 2.7 billion and just completely dropped off the face of the earth
I just laughed so hard.

I think we should get a shirt that says "we will fucking haze you"
This design is final, hence why you all are seeing it now
"Shmeat McGee's"
ESPECIALLY if it said lil shmeat McGee's
If there's still enough opposition, I don't feel like pushing for it is worth it. Are 'Fantastic' or 'incredible' still being considered or..?
I'm signing on to my metal box contraption to do it now because lets be honest if it said fabulous, frabulous or "lil shmeat McGee's" I'll still order one 
He said he sent one
It's also on fb
@Andrew Ward Was there an email? I just haven't checked yet 
Honestly just try it
Was the form messing up for anyone else on their phone?
The sugar 
Go fill out the t shirt form the order has to close in a few days if you want them on time
Yeah I can see that! Is it the sugar or the flavor that leads to it hurting 
I love thotties @Jim Gordon 
It hurts 
On a side note now I want to shotgun a limarita 
Professional image means everything. We don't cater to every other organization, because we're sigma chi were the fuckin best. We're in it to give the entire world our image. I think Charles hit it head on it would be an inside joke and wouldn't be beneficial for recruitment 
Yeah I understand
To an extent I don't care either but in my mind this is something easy that we can avoid. Just my two cents. At the end of the day it is what it is. 
The way I look at it, I hang out with ASAs, phi delts, and the occasional Phi Sig, and all of them would think it was dope so that's why I'm not worried what other organizations would think of it
I guess, I could not care any less what other organizations think of us in any capacity.
None
Again not worried about potentials I'm worried about other greek organizations. It would definitely get made fun of. If that makes me less frat for caring about how other organizations view us then give me a limarita because I'm a geed. 
Shouldn't not do something because we're afraid. We're frat and fraternity and putting a small joke on a shirt isn't something that will hurt that image
If someone won't join over a shirt then better for us
At the end of the day its a shirt, its not that serious
I don't think people would pay attention that much honestly
No frabulous 
Lmfao ok Riley has sold me 
All good points 
I think putting frabulous on the back would make us a target but others in greek life. We already had the reputation for awhile as being "nerds that read tfm". I'd prefer to not feed into that. We have plenty of other reasons to get cyber bullied lets stick to those. 
All good points 
I like frabulous 
But i feel like we want to be inviting, not like "ha check out our inside jokes." But i also wouldn't mind having a sweet shirt that says frabulous
Frockets
Fuck
Yeah but putting (fr) for "fradjectives" is funny and all but on a shirt that would be incredibly try hard. 
It's like an inside joke, those who get it are definitely good potentials
"Dank"
I was kind of joking about frabulous. Haha i feel like to most people it'd just look like fabulous, and then anyone who did look closely enough would just be confused. Although it's a good talking point
FRABULOUS is my new fav word now. 
I love the poster and don't want that to change, but I think shirts are something we can pull frabulous off with
Yeah actually frabulous would be great for shirts
My vote is "the frabulous"
None
Fantastic?
we used "incredible" on the poster
Yea I think the fabulous is kinda weird, but I feel like otherwise it doesn't make sense 
Frabulous
I too like everything but fabulous. The sucky part is it works for the sign but makes us seem effeminate. Maybe another adjective can be thrown in there that'll work
THATS THE COOLEST FUCKING THING EVER BEN GET THEM
its a frocket in case you couldnt tell
idk how I feel about fabulous but design and the front chip thing is really dope

Saw this yak that was posted at RIT 
The program is a nice way to grow academically but more professionally and career due to the coop program. I've learned a lot out of it and it has made me try a lot of new stuff I probably wouldn't have tried out. Hope that helps :D
2 of the 3 classes I took were experimental classes(we were the pilot program for it basically) to see how it would go. They were structured, but you also had some room to try new things out (hence the experimental part). I think it's really cool stuff since some of those classes set the standard for that particular class a few years later
No problem brother
Thanks for the help guys
Yeah, the honors class i took was a super whack set up, a kind of weird subject, but not that hard. But that's all i've seen so far
So it's more of a different class setup then just covering more difficult subjects
In terms of if it's worth it, kind of depends what you want to do after you graduate. It's not hugely beneficial if you want to just go straight to work in a techy field, but i think it's worth a try at least. If you study abroad you can get a lot of credits, and they'll give you 500 dollars for study abroad
I liked the honors class since you get more involved (projects, leading the discussion)!than a lecture class. I thought it was easier than a "just lecture" class that some of my peers were taking at the same time. That also depends on your learning style 
I was late entry. Personally I think the late entry has more merit than the people who come in as honors due to the rigorous standards and seats available
I'm going to try to stick with it unless the honors credit part gets unbearable. I took a freshman honors class instead of year one that gave me a 4th of my credits already. It wasn't very bad at all, and then I'm taking a cool product innovation course this semester
Are the honors classes any harder?
Pretty much what Adnan said, early registration was so helpful. Going to the committee meetings count as community service hours so it's easy to get involved if you want to also. I'm not sure if I'd say it was worth it since you're coming in later though - a huge perk of it for me was having honors orientation and housing, so a ton of my friends I met through that. Besides that, I don't really do anything with honors besides the classes. 
For the requirements, basically what @Charles Hem said. If you're late entry you only need 9 honors points (they Give you 3 since you came in late) and there's a GPA requirement(I know this is on the website, not sure on the top of my head). This is assuming they haven't changed it since beginning Fall 2015 semester 
I'm not super involved with it though, however I thought I'd give some popular insights. I know you can sit on committees, represent your college to the honors council. They have free pizza Friday's and a dinner once a semester 
For 1st and 2nd years it's really good for the enrollment part since you get "upgraded" to the next year level. Not as useful as you go on as most majors get specific and don't get full as fast. (Depends on the major obviously) Most of the programs go to a city and explore different companies. Last year SCB went to NYC and this year were going to Chicago. Those are nice as you get an idea of your industry/similar majors industries, networking. I know some people who've gotten coops with it too. 
I am. I think it is
Is it worth it?
Yeah, 20 hours of community service each year and 12 honors credits at graduation. The honors website has how to get honors credits somewhere
Once you're in the program, are there any extra things you would be required to do?
Yeah, i am. Wassup?
Yes. About 21% of the student population is.
@Charles Hem 
Is anyone in the honors program at rit?
What was tried in the past?
There's interest and its been made/tried. It just needs a dedicated system
I'll see if amar is interested in making one
So no
We have a somewhat disorganized library system that might be inactive
I'm a firm believer in saying whatever the fuck you want, but don't be pissy if people don't like you for it/you don't want to deal with the consequences
Totally different topic but do we have any sort of textbook sharing system set up? 
I'm a firm believer in saying whatever the fuck you want, but don't be pissy if people don't like you for it/you don't want to deal with the consequences
I'll text you
So go into it 
No I don't actually 
I won't go into it here, but you can see why your first explanation doesn't stand up to scrutiny, right @Frock star ?
In truth though I feel like the word should be lost in history 
Eh. It's reclamation of the word that oppressed them 
I.E. axid, and actually a lot of girls in general, with retard, or lutfring with the n word apparently. Juans ok as long as the n word fairies have deemed it righteous
Well yeah if we're gonna step outside groupme logic for a sec, the whole idea of words being ok for some groups and not for others is bunk. You should speak decently with regards to current company. If they're ok with using it, you should be too.

Don't know if you heard, but the prophet has already spoken on this matter

Then all black people around the world will know about your privileges and you'll be cool to use them on anyone
Followed by the symbol of black unity (fist bump)
You must have a certified black person verbally give you the power to use the n word
Does that mean I can say nigglet?

She would also tell me to go into the corner on time out and tell me "we don't tattle in this house, you need to deal with things yourselves."
Believe me I don't tattle.. My mom used to hit me when I was little of i told on someone.. I like immediate responses you know this 
He would've caught up anyway, but now I know the type I'm dealing with...
You said if he calls you out... Just wanna see his opinion. Not "telling" on anyone

Maybe if you're taking a class you can get permission? I know in golisano there is a lab that is only open to a few majors, but if you're taking certain classes you'll gain swipe access regardless of major  
I think you need to be in a major that has access to the cage 
@Charles Hem You may be able to borrow one from the film cage plz confirm @Ben Zenker

The bundles will have just about everything you need. Not processional level but it gets the job done
If you want additional lens for different reasons, it'll cost more
Ashtray money
Depending on what you are looking yo spend, a beginner camera bundle on sale is less than $500. 
The D in dslr stands for digital, so i was clarifying
I know what you're talking about, i didn't mean a gopro

That's a go pro 
Oh fuck I feel old if you don't know what a digital camera is
The flip phone camera provides the best quality 
No a razer

It's not super uncommon to see a high truck with confederate flags flying though
Lol unless i start doing a ton of outdoors shit, I'm not gonna get a truck ever
Charles, you should fly a couple of these bad boys when you inevitably get a truck
Conspiracy 
I want everyone to visit just to see what they think about it

Sis can give you an unofficial 
Sis
Hey, anyone, where can I ask for a transcript? Looking to apply for a scholarship 
Nah he didn't do it, that's why I asked him to confirm in general
Ben got big balls for doing that. Probably got calluses. 
I think the embarrassment would build character. @Ben Zenker , can you confirm this in general?
It's not desperate, it's uh.... Self motivation. I think.... Maybe 
When you so desperate for happy birthdays you get congratulate yourself in all your group messages, even the awkward ones with people you don't talk to anymore
Word it's your birthday too. Twinzies
Thanks Jake. Happy birthday btw. 
^ can confirm 
It's like talking to yourself, right Jake?
No, I meant the OG joke was funny so the self high five seemed unnecessary. But you do you
Haha yeah i was more kinda just sharing that Pat, wasn't offended or anything
Why do I even try
I thought it was funny tho...
Like*
Charles is on a whole other level
If you can masturbate for self pleasure, you damn right you can self life your message. 
It's like telling a shitty joke and high fiving yourself. A great tactic because the actual joke sucked but people will laugh that you high fived yourself for it
Ain't nothing wrong with a self like, nothing wrong with that 
Not worth my time. 
Lol no. And that's why I'm not going to lol
I do that on yik yak ;)

Her sister is more of a cutie. 
I'll invite her sister
That's the idea
It's like regular sex but instead of crying and apologizing after you finish in 5 seconds, you just cackle and leave
It's not revenge if you both benefit
Its like regular sex except you yell "Revenge is mine!" and then disappear in a cloud if purple smoke
I mean, show her you appreciate her company
Nah, get some revenge sex
Bout to get it ordered and tell them I'll have it to go and leave 
My ex texted me happy birthday and offered lunch.

It just gets weird when you swipe right on everyone and match with RIT girls who you don't actually want to talk to and end up by them in line at Gracies
Nope
Not at all
Is it weird that I like tindering for the fun of liking hot chicks but most of the time I just dick around when it comes to matches?

NYPD officers are funny af. One of the most lively forces I've met 
Bby*
I'm busy, you're on your own be

Right @Justin E 
So your state doesn't know how to effectively use a police force? 
How is this relevant at all? Next you'll be saying our trees look dumb compared to ny trees
Our state likes us so they make the state troopers easier to spot. I'm sure Cuomo got a hard on approving that design
Lol no. Your cars just look dumb

Also, I'd been on campus like 2 weeks before orientation. I was alpha shitter by then

No wonder you guys didn't wanna dance with your OA

I wish my grandparent saved money for plastic surgery once I was born
Left a bad impression on me 
They are the og fuccbois
I don't like Korean dudes. 
I can't mess with them
And they pull it off 
Korean fuccbois....
Korea is full of plastic
Korean girls are k
Asian chicks are literally all the same
Koreans guys need to piss off. At least NYC Korean fuckbois
Korean bitches 😍
New Years resolution, accept 1 more Korean in my life. 
Half those kids have their parents write their essays 
Damn Koreans 
Korean kid too
Its just a really dumb system
But ooooo the Asian kid in front of my got in with a 5 something 
I don't remember my score but it was high enough for a school
I'm mad I got like a 500 or some shit and I didn't get into tech
Bronx science is all suicidal Asians
Unless you are an alum/have money for to test prep
A lot of kids who graduate from like Bronx, stuy and tech were pretentious af

I'm injecting a marijuana 
Can't, I have a busy day of butt chugging ahead of me
Anyone else shooting butt fireworks tomorrow?
Yeah, ours was basically the same but on a different scale
Yo already heard firecrackers outside. 
So if your AP Calc class grade was a 100, when it was getting averaged in with other grades, it would be 110.
But when it got calculated into your term GPA, they add an additional 10% of that grade in.
Or AP math. 
If you took an AP science course, your report card grade. Would be on a 100 scale 
We were on some dumbass 6.0 scale
100 scale makes a lot more sense
Hahaha "holy shit bro, i got 1200 bonus points!!!1!"
SAT scores were a joke in my school. Everyone was like "YO I GOT A 1300 yo!" I'm like "uh you know it's a 2400 scale dude"
Yea. It wasn't bad. 
You guys did GPA just on a 100 scale?
Average GPA was like a 68 or something. Idk how my school is still surviving 
And top 25 students didn't have grades higher than 96 
Oh yea I was way too competitive in high school. Only with the top 25 students. Everyone else was like, whatevs I'm graduating k
So it was a joke. 
Oh yea same with me. My school had majority of APs but everyone did pretty bad on them 
I'm also all about competition
Eh i feel like you can argue for both sides. I went to a school like yours kinda and was able to be at the top, but I think having only 2 AP classes and an uninteresting school sort of hurt my applications
Given my graduating class was 300/800 something, yea that's disgusting. So it's easy to be in the top 50 or so if you cared about graduating. 
Let's put it this way: try to outshine a bunch of other 4.0 students when your graduating class is roughly 500 plus. That's tech. More competition.

My school was: do some type of leadership shit, decent grades (85+), ez way to make yourself look like top notch stuff. 
Tell him it's literally nothing special. 

All the people i know from there seem decently chill though 
Hahaha totally gonna tell my friend who went there that it's a fuck boy school
Tech doesn't mean shit when you get to RIT 
Lol fuck boy school
Yeah a friend was telling me about that system and it was kinda confusing. What's your read on brooklyn tech?
NYC kids apply for high school. So competitive for no reason. I went to a shit high school and ended up at the same college as a kid who went to the best specialized high school in the city. 
And convince her your parents are filthy rich that your hearing aids improve normal Geed hearing to some next level fox hearing 
Convince her you have amazing hearing 
The gulf coast of mississippi is kind of cool in that all the coastal cities are fairly connected. Like you could know a lot of names from the other cities even though you don't know them. Seems kind of different from when i hear NYC kids talk about high school
Yeah dude, I'm swiping in dangerous territory down here at home... 
Lol people down here would be like, "what's sign?"
Charles you're literally my favorite person 
Wait Charles holy shit 236 mutual friends? 
Then be like "wow you're fucked up. Just because I'm HoH doesn't mean I know sign the fuck"
Ask her to call you and be like "sorry I'm hard of hearing. Can we FaceTime and sign?"
You kinda right tho

Ah, poop

Alright, I'm starting a team for wednesday 8-11
Yeah. Brothers were interested in soccer the most and I'm sure some would be willing to play on multiple teams as long as it's not a Sunday night league
We had plenty of people who wanted to play though right?
I killed the team cause I wasn't gonna be managing it. Anyone's free to start a brothers only rec team

Could've said something in senate before applications were due but people don't reach out to their constituents as well as I'd like
Like not wait for people to sign, literally go to clubs/sports, invite them and ask them for a member
Randos off the street don't have the popularity base to make it a thing with non-greeks
*point
They'd need to reach out to larger clubs/Athletics 
At this points its, Mr Greek rit
Farid won because he was fucking talented 
Is this what the founders would've wanted
Like if they got people from sports,clubs and msos you can get a much bigger audience and note people will know what it is
And thus Farid won
Lol that clearly worked
But didn't do very well. Also a lot of non Greeks don't even know what it is
Apparently they tried to get more non Greeks this year 
#facts
Mr RIT could be bigger if every single contestant wasn't greek
Cute
Pretty normal 
People screamed "you're mr RIT!" 
I've had a guy and a girl ask me if I was the college of science senator at party. That was pretty weird
I'm known for many things. Like Being lit, Mr. RIT, class act, not massive but still pretty big

Yeah i thought about that too. I would just become a monster at rockclimbing for my workouts then
Going to the gym would suck too
Not from Indians though lol
It originated from archers marching into battle flipping people off. 
That smells like some bs
Didn't flipping people off originate from like indians doing it to show they still had their bow finger? Or am I tripping?
Lol Charles
Boobs wouldn't be bad without thumbs tho
First thing i thought of was my dick, damn
...boobs?
Try grabbing the things you love without thumbs
You're right though, you could never thumbs up... damn...
Hey, you don't talk about thumbless people like that!
People without thumbs are clowns
Easy, yeah
Not my right thumb
That's easy 
Yes 
But would you trade a finger to sleep with all of them?
Pat, that's a great idea. America, Fuck Yeah!
@Frock star Doesn't matter. I'll find one again at some point 
Cut my balls off I'm fucking the whole lot of  mrs universe candidates

Yo dad you should get the background edited to be like a massive American flag
I'd do it 
Yup 
Threw me for a sec. Does your answer change though?
an award... Read Charles message as I was typing 
SHE DESERVED A CHILD 
I would still say no, unless I could save sperm to have a child
@Dad SHE IS A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN 
Haha 
More than some of my other lines were yes 
Still nope.
Then you can win the espy courage award
With a dick 
Which means afterwards you basically become a woman 
Just the balls are gone 
I thought it was just the balls
Wait let's ask that question 
The babeology line is workin for yoy?
Missed that part
I was gonna say lol 😂
You need a penis tho hahaha
Just saying Mike, you don't need your balls to masturbate .
I probably wouldn't use it dad, too posed
Lol by the way that babes ology line is the best thing I've ever used Charles thank you 
You would definitely want to masturbate after remembering that awesome month too
Jk, you right tho
No, I don't masturbate because I'm not a nasty, immature boy. *sup nods and winks at all the immature girls*
Nothing. Was a pic from Friday. Had a presentation on Friday
Do you know how good that is? 
No way. It would be an amazing month, but then I couldn't masturbate anymore 
@Charles Hem  And no I wouldn't.
Debatable since the backgrounds not great. What're you rockin right now?
None
Charles, profile pic worthy?
By one night with each i mean one night per candidate, so it'd be multiple nights
You get one night with every miss universe candidate, but afterwards your penis and balls are removed. Do you do it?
I used to know. But photos should have a folder named "recently deleted"

Anybody know how to access deleted photos via ifile

So true. When I hit the slopes I put down the booze and pick up the bleach 
Idk, i can control my drinking much easier. If I'm p high i react so slow 
It's much more dangerous lol 
Actually becomes dangerous to yourself, other people...and most importantly the trees and ski lift poles!
I'm more concerned with the people getting hammered on the slope
Maybe if i were just slightly buzzed
Nah man it makes you better
I'm too green in the skis for SUI still
Chug a six pack and hit the slopes
We need to ski bristol sometime
Is what it seems like
It just combines like high adrenaline with chilled out wanting to sit
It is 
I bet it's awesome
Being high on a slope doesn't seem chill to me
Yeah smelled some guys doing that
In a gondola?? That's ballsy. Chairlifts are the way to go for that
Haha yeah my brother said he was in the gondola today and some guys blazed up real quick
Lol come skiing with me and my friends 
Haha there's a pretty big rivalry between the two it seems like. Like I always feel like snowboarders are kind of like chilled out stoner high schoolers and i have no reason to feel like that

Juan, that usage of gay was accusatory. Only use it if you genuinely believe they're in the closet and publicly dragging them out helps

Thanks for the poke @Asa Snyder 
If you use the Hudson water as lube your genitals mutate
Fuck that didnt work 
#topic hudson valley lube 
Do u guys use craft beer and water from the hudson river as lube? Srs anwrs only no joke thread thnx 
^ actual shitpost
Technically it's constrained by blood vessels, but sure
I may be Italian heritage and culturally, but my blood is as free as yours pal. 
I'm an American thank you 
Military tactics or power 
That's because you don't have any ^^
Should have said that from the beginning 
If you've been to a Christmas Eve dinner with Italians you're good @Pat Furrey. 
We don't talk about our military tactics or political power. We talk about our food and women 
Feast of the seven fishes on Christmas Eve 
7
Italy lost to Ethiopia too
People don't forget 
The course before you eat
Italy sided with the nazis in ww2
I've had antipasto with my friends family. I don't know how many fishes are served but I've been to a Christmas eve dinner where there was literally only seafood and a sea of italians
Antipasto is easy, but I am curious about the fish one
I'll even bump it to the Christmas Eve question 
Two 
If he can answer my tepid questions he's good by me 
He just wasn't born Italian
But he did work for it
If you didn't work for it you didn't earn it. 
And how many types of fish are acceptable on Christmas Eve 
It's like getting an honorary doctorate, you didn't actually complete the requirements, but for all intents and purposes you did the work
What's antipasto
Doesn't honorary imply they aren't actually Italian, but have all the makings of one
Lmao
I'm as honorary italian as you are honorary black
@Luther Heigl Knows 
We have meetings at the Glasco firehouse or sues. 
That's like me saying I'm honorary black 
Don't you guys have Italian cards and give out Italian privileges?
You can embrace Italian traditions and culture, but that doesn't mean your Italian. 
That's not a thing 
You aren't honorary Italian 

Teachers would ask about heritage in class and the vast majority of kids would raise their hands for italian. All my friends were italian, hell I was basically an honorary italian
Oh gotcha
Fourth of July 
@Michael Yaeger We're having a sigma chi party in Saugerties this year at your house my house and Luthers house 
Huh what?
Have fun with the cast of jersey shore 
you have "Italians" who are terrible. You have more because the good Italians of New York kicked their sorry asses out 
It does and I'm beating the shit out of it
The Italian argument only works on Lutfring
LOL YOU HAVE NO CLUE 
Relinquished*. We have better Italian Americans and more of them. We literally have the better iteration of your culture
(Love you though, just not your state)
What's it like being born into a lower level state?
Nuff said 
Jersey sucks 
DAE realize they went from defending NYS, to upstate NY, to basically just their county? Meanwhile Jersey strong over here never consolidated one part of the great state
Luther Heigl changed the group's name to Mike and Luther jerk off over Hudson Valley
I'm related to half the police force so we'll be fine 
While intoxicated 
My house would be open potentially too. 
We'll make a list of shit to do and just take over the area
Savage. Do it, if you start planning I can talk to my parents and we can get something going
Let's do it
lol I'll plan a social in Saugerties 
I really wanna do that now 
Seriously though 
I'm on board
@Luther Heigl @Michael Yaeger 
Then we can go visit Newburgh and get shot
Let's have a Fourth of July sigma chi party in Saugerties 
(Well pick you up
Train to rhinecliff across the river from us 
Grand Central to Poughkeepsie, I'll pick you up
I'll always have a hype boner for the state that's the living embodiment of capitalist America
TFW no car
Line
Haha that was a p steaksauce libe 
Invest in yourself. Visit the Hudson valley 
@Jim Gordon Personal finance 101
Make my mom make us homemade pizza the next day 
Maybe I'll visit your hudson valley and change my opinion but for right now I'm going to go get a luke warm bfast sandwhich from mcdonalds and study for personal finance  
We can go cliff jumping during the day, drink later at @Michael Yaeger  
Literally we can do so much. Three of us live there @Michael Yaeger @Luther Heigl and myself so tons of room. 
During the summer 
Valley 
And yeah for real, everyone should come visit. It's dope
Hudson Valle my for fucking life 
Lutfring and I will never give up
@Jim Gordon You still have to come to New York to visit it though 
Lol aight I'm done with this circlejerk. I'm going to go study. Hope your penis' don't get sore hype train 
NC does have some quality ass BBQ, I'll give them that
@Pat Furrey You won't be in five years guarantee it 
I'm not saying it's significantly more accessible to us. I just think it does the things you mentioned better, save craft beers as I'm a cheap beer kind of guy
White women are the best I'll be honest. Especially Italians. There's a lot of Italians in New York. They're the best. They're hot when you're young and probably when they're older too. Plus very Italian women I know makes me eat. A lot. 
Hudson Valley brew scene is second only to Portland
Its ours
History bonus: Battle of Saratoga was a major turning point of the Revolutionary War (when we started kicking ass)
The only way to get to the island is through new jersey gun slinger 
North Carolina? Doesn't have craft beers and it's a hell of a drive
Theres pretty places in every state 
God bless
The white women are more attractive there too Juan
So basically 
Hella white women, I'll let Lutfring field that one
If I wanted any of those things I would go to NC
White wimmen?
I mean but your beautiful scenery can be found anywhere. It's not really a selling point  
NYC quality Sushi
Craft beers, good BBQ, you name it Hudson Valley probably has it
ARIEL FOR THE FUCKING WIN 
And Saratoga is amazing shut your whore mouth @Pat Furrey 
I'm pretty sure if a landmark is within my state, it's ours
Albany is close to Troy and Troy is terrible 
We're talking an hour south of Albany
We have snowboarding, lakes, the best trails,
Albany and Buffalo are trash
I've visited Albany, Saratoga, and Buffalo. Saratoga was ok, the rest were trash
Forever 
Between the city and Saratoga  you will find a place to live  
I wish NYC had trees
And yeah it's mostly suburbs, but there's plenty to do
That's it 
Past Saratoga is trees 
This is the shit part of upstate. Hudson Valley is where it's at
We literally have everything. 
Not even good suburbs 
Isnt this upstate? Its just suburbs with nothing to do
*it
For whatever reason. Bronx has Yankee stadium. That's ut
There's a difference 
Have you ever visited upstate or just drove through it @Pat Furrey 
Every where else has nothing
Hell I might even take a half hour train ride in from NJ
You just haven't been to the good parts of upstate then
You can visit manhattan
I would never live in the city, if possible, but it's way better to visit than upstate ny
In the mean time lets talk about the Hudson valley. Easily one of the best places to live in the country 
Right. You hate on your only asset though. 
We're still in proximity to it. If NYC joined a different state we'd lose the tax revenue, but the money would still flow upstate
Good thing we have the city then @Jim Gordon 
Nyc makes up double the tax revenue and money flow then upstate. Without nyc upstate new york would be a bigger shithole then Iowa 
Living in the city is awful
We don't talk about that 
Woodstock is fucked up 
More people move upstate after experiencing the city 
Only Woodstock
Haha bunch of hippies
And I'm two hours @Jim Gordon but on the way I pass through beautiful mountain ranges and 
Inferior upstaters and their beliefs
Come to the Hudson Valley some time. There's a reason a ton of actors have homes up there
NYC is the worst part of the state.
Clearly you've never been upstate. 
It's actually a city of New York, where the name comes from. 
They disown the best part of their state
It actually is
:O
You are right, it basically is new York state
NYC is trash, you can have it
Yeah okay. You all just salty the statue of liberty in the greatest state of the union. And yeah okay. Its only really connected to nyc. How close are you to nyc mike? I can be in the city by train in 30 minutes. Nyc is basically not new york state 
New Jersey 
Its like 1/9003836261 new hearth 
The Hudson River starts in New York, and blesses you with its presence as it dumps into the ocean. How dare you claim Hudson River 
The Statue of Liberty is a French immigrant 
The person who discovered America was a Viking that landed in Nova Scotia and didn't know fuck all about where he was #facts
Which is half new jersey. The hudson travels through parts of new jersey. It separates the states. We also have the statue of liberty pussies
But chose to settle in Virginia
The person who discovered America discovered it through the Hudson River 
Thomas Edison and George Washington headquarters in new jersey. Alot of the revolutionary war was fought in new jersey. The battle for Connecticut  farms was one of the last battles of the war, stopped the brits from getting to morristown where Washington was camped out and is a town over from me. 
🔑
Ulster county law was what the constitution was based on 
Stfu juan new York and NYC are different entities in this context
Nigga, we rich
Jersey only gets hate from the shithole that is new york. Wtf has new york done in American history? New Jersey was at the forefront of war and invention 
Because I can handle success
Just another obstacle. But we will overcome 🙏
They don't want us to go 15 over
they don't want us to ride jetskis
But I do 
Luther doesn't have the keys to success

#ridewithme 
1 person in Jersey is too dense of a population
Jersey also has Chris Christie as governor... Soooo
Back in North Jersey 15 over is a standard. Helps thin the already too dense population
Yeah 10 over in NY and you're playing with fire. Apparently fucking 5 over in VA and you're playing with fire though
We aren't in Virginia anymore pal
Regulate Peter lol 
Juan don't make me hunt you
Lol yes it is tho. On the thruway they start to pull you over if you're 10 over 
Send help
The two worst possible people have those weapons
I say we march over to balantyne road and we regulate Peter until he says hes sorry
Just Max
Into S&M huh 
Up to 15 over isn't even bad. After that, it's dicey
And we have a whip and slingshot so it's real now
Me? Nooo 
But then we can jboard you
I'm aware haha it was a joke 
But we can kick their fucking ass right? 
And no we can't jboard alumni
It's better than 23
Sounds a pedophile comment...
Depending on the court he could argue it down to a 13
Especially if you're not on the thruway 
No 13 is bad pat lol 
I propose jail time for this infraction. Can we also jboard alumni? If so I think this ticket shows unbecoming of a Sigma Chi 
13 isn't bad guys, let's be real
Anyone know if it was a trooper or Henrietta cop?
Which admits that he knew he was going over by a lot lol
Still over by 13 buddy 
"I thought it was 65 here"
The comment kills me 
It was on bailey road. All I could've hit were people running out of the phi psi house straight into the road
Although if that says misdemeanor at the bottom then it was reckless
Yeah, Pat is right. I just checked, NY is a state where it's up to the officer. Other states it's automatic at 15+
What about the children?
Not necessarily reckless, mine didn't add it
It depends on what the officer decides to add
78 in a 55 is reckless
78 in a 55 = points I think right? Our boy boutta pay an extra hubdo a year on insurance 
Oh yes
None
But let's go back to this 
But Hilary doesn't have any actual stand points. All she does is flip flop between sides and then say she's always been behind it. She lies all the time, and to me she's more scum than trump. Trumps an idiot, but genuinely wants to "make America great again" through the policies he believes. That means more to me than someone whose a professional politician good at getting things to get re-elected.
On the Hillary v Trump question, it's actually a difficult one. Once you wade through the stupid shit Trump holds a mainly libertarian point of view, which I tend to agree with. But without knowing whether what he's saying is a campaign tactic or his genuine plans then I don't feel comfortable voting for him. Hillary is a born and bred politician though, she'll actually pass things, and while I don't 100% agree with her points of view they're better than nothing/dumb shit
*stated
Just deny it publicly
Well, it's not states they don't believe it
And I'll be the first to rub it in non climate change believers faces 
Men, profit lives matter
Well it's gonna fuckkkkkk them up. 
South***
I mean its scummy that dumbasses in the house take the rhetoric and believe it but I understand the "deny until the last minute" strategy.  
Mike carter for president 
#MakeAmericaFratAgain
Cargo ships = cargo shorts 
Energy is a huge industry. It's definitely one of them
One of them. 
So is big oil the main republican donator then? 
Why do you think big oil wants to deny climate change? More regulation = eating into profits. They would have to have stricter pollution regulation, none of those massive cargo ships sailing the ocean blue and the list goes on. Accepting climate change is very bad for business in the short term 
Why 
They do. It's just been pitched by their donators to act dumb on the issue. 
~30% of voters minds aren't made up until the last week. The sandman still has a chance if he keeps appealing to minorities and gaining momentum
WHY DONT REPUBLICANS BELIEVE IN FUCKING CLIMATE CHANGE 
And says dumb shit on the side
He has shining moments
General election. Trump vs Hilldog. What do you do? 
Noooooo I don't wanna read that 
Oh jeez, ruby-poo. http://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/melanie-hunter/rubio-humans-not-responsible-climate-change-way-some-these-peopleare
I'd move 
Hillary....
So sanders? 
He also wouldn't win a general election 
I only vote third party candidates to protest the oppressive two party regime. Down with the Oligarchs! 
He would literally nuke the world 
This is our only chance to make this happen
Just give trump the nomination 
bruh
Back to sanders I go
I'm taking the poster of him down from my wall 
He's got some sus ass stances
Damnit Rubio 
But he's so cute
He said some scummy shit about gay marriage earlier this week 
He's so cute
I like Rubio 
And yes
Fiorina
Ok I can't type her last name but we know who I'm talking about 
Don't hurt yourself
Carly florins 
Can we all agree that Carly Florida is a little bitch tho 
Yeah there are definitely Sanders Trump parallels
In fact it's almost the exact same sort of campaign that Sanders is running, just the opposite end of the spectrum
I'd argue he's a fantastic politician, he's using the media and targeting a group that feels underrepresented in recent years
All Politicians say stuff like that though, Trump just gets more attention because he's inflammatory with what he says. Nah it's alright, this still helps me
He's a non politician, but excellent businessman
Donald Trump can't be bought unlike other candidates 
I'm not good at finding arguments to support trump I guess. My bad haha @Luther Heigl 
Lol that's literally what he says to argue. 
That's just words to fire people up, he needs arguments boi
It's rhetoric. There's a difference between argument and rhetoric. While they way he phrased it is stupid as shit, and shows a lack of understanding, the core idea of his "penetrate the internet" is pretty much standard policy
Literally just say things like "you know we need to be more tough. We're not so tough anymore. We need to go over there and show them how strong we are. America never wins anymore and I gotta tell you, it's because of all of this political correctness. It's trash. I want Americas next and brilliant to shut down the Internet so they can't get our own people against us. It's that simple. We win they lose"
We dont win anymore
Those are his actual arguments 
You don't understand 
Too easy, I'd need to actually argue it
*enrichment
Would recommend ijreview, newsmax, and drudgereport for culture immersion @Luther Heigl 
@Luther Heigl Literally just use the words tough, great, strong. Everyone should have guns, infiltrate the Internet, and no non American Muslims 
I'm about to head to work and do nothing for 6 hours
One of my friends back home is absurdly liberal, and I'm thinking of brushing up on my Trump support so that I can get her riled up
Guess who just took a 2 hour nap at work 
Goes with my Confederate flag
I do want a make america great again hat tho

Please go into detail of what non white things are 
God bless, church of lit
Litness*
Litness is a mentality, an essence, a defining trait of who you are. I'm Mike Lutfring and I am lit 
It doesn't. You're associating lines with nonwhite things tho
I can teach you the ways @Pat Furrey. But you need to get rid of the primitive thought that how lit you are is related to your skin color.

Would you say you're woke
No I'm white. But lit. I don't think you get that. 
However one girl did tell me one time she heard I was black. I
So you're a wigger
But lit. There's a difference 
I'm white 
No 
so youre black
As far as white guys go I'm usually like one of 3 most places I go 
And some Hispanic, even a few Asians. 
I just happen to be surround fellow lit human beings, who are black. 
I identify as a lit* person 
I'm pretty sure Lutfring identifies as a black person

Was aragon like how you train your dragon 3? I loved that movie. The banter between the cowboy and spaceman was superb 
True the movie adaptation was way better tho
Lol. Reading is for pussies. I get all of my entertainment from good old American Tv. Reading is a chore why can't robots just read for us!

That egg thing, chicken feet, bbq pork stuff (pronounced char siu), grass jelly drink, and this egg custard thing (pronounced Dan tat)
Right 
So the pizza had mounds of cash or body parts on it? 
And speaking of mobs. One of the guys that the movie goodfellas was based off of just got off from trial even though he had 14 counts against him. It was made very clear in the article that jury came to a quick decision after eating lunch delivered from a pizzeria in Brooklyn called joes pizza

The road with the porn shop. Pass the jiffy lube and keep going straight
I think it's basically across the street in the right from that plaza 
You're gonna head down on brighton
In the plaza with the board game store?
yeah that place is like the sketchiest asian food market ive ever been..cant even denote the dialect of those guys
I been there it's lit 
I'll eat just about anything put in front of me at least once
Right next to Arby's?
Asian market. 
Asia market? @Justin E 
For real? I'm gonna go get some tomorrow. What's the address?
As a Half Chinese guy, I approve for human consumption 
But it's just aged cheese lol
dood theres an asian food market like 5 minutes from here..they got this filth
That's like me saying "some cheese made in the Middle Ages shit"
As COS senator, I do not endorse human consumption
That's what you should have said lol @Raptor 
Jake get some of those shipped over I want to try one
The science behind that is fucking gross
actually im quite the opposite of a fan....i hate when its in my congee
Mm
It's packed in a mixture to preserve it for a month or two
im not a fan...but i dont like eggs
No we shit on it and run it on our eyes 
Shit son I want to try that
You piss on the egg 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Century_egg
You haven't lived until you go to a nice sit down Italian place. Chicken parm with house made sauce and noodles.  Oh Marone 👌🔥🔥🔥
If you wanna go straight hick, like next level, piss
I can't believe you put Indian food over Italian. I'm crestfallen
The name is deceiving and you should have went into further detail 
Now I'm curious 
How do you make that 
Yes 
The name of the egg is 1000 year old egg?
Bad eggs? They're perfectly fine. They're cooked a certain way and it's given that name 
Lmao I didn't actually think that! Don't use that as an argument if it's not the 
BBQ > Sushi > Grill > Indian > Italian probably
Italian american food is nothing close to Italian
My man @Grant Scheynost 
Mike the type of kid to be like "the world is 2015 years old"
I know it's but it implies that you use bad eggs 😂😂
Can confirm, Olive Garden is nothing close to Italian 
^
its not actually 1000 years old
Good shit Riley 
LOL YOU SAID SOME 1000 YEAR OLD EGG SHIT 
1) american food
2) Italian food 
3) mexican food
4) Japanese food
5) Polish food
 
"Stale" yet Chinese food has some amazing tastes.
Wtf is your list @Luther Heigl ?
I love authentic asian food but i don't fuck with tripe too much. It doesn't add anything for me
Lol "stale" 
That's ok Luther it doesn't have to be every bodies favorite, but it 90% is on the list 
Lol no it's not stale and doesn't reek. You're right 
Actually it might be fourth or fifth, I lied
Sounds like someone who's chickening out. So Italian food isn't as impressive as Chinese food. K
Italian is, like, third on my list of preferred food
That's why people like Italian food more 
I'm talking about some thousand year old egg shit. Some shit that'll make your clothes reek of Chinese food. Best wear your bummy clothes 
and no but i enjoy tripe
to jakes statement
What 
^not even at meal time...just time to shove food down your throat
You ever eat a meal around cow tongue 
And yes there are 4 course meals when it comes to grandma cooking. Grandma don't play 
Actually, I will respectfully say that Italians are impressive if you can sit down and handle a 4 course meal cooked from an old Asian grandma. And not some American, 4 piece chicken wing with French fries or pork fried rice. I'm talking about the the shit real Chinese hicks eat
Or in general for that matter 
If you think Olive Garden is Italian then you literally haven't had good Italian food 
I think I'm only identifying with lutfring rn bc of how much I love NJ
Let me tell you that Olive Garden is some of those most authentic Italian food ever. 
wushu = chinese martial arts "kung fu"
You mean Olive Garden? 
Said no one ever 
Italians aren't impressive anyways. 
No that's the little kid pasta you eat. Let me know when you mess with real Italian food 
So you gave it to a little kid and made odd shapes ? Kewl

@Frock star Too lazy to copy paste. Replace Asian with Hispanic.

Really, just go have sex at that point
Those dances are always weird
Sounds like a good night for me
It was lit 
Na she was into it 
Sounds kinda rapey
@Charles Hem I saw a girl get thrown on a table and have her hair pulled, almost breaking the table and basically havin sex.

@Frock star Doesn't know anything 
My sample size of 1 agrees
His last secretary was Tia, so he probably only hires Greeks
Lol no it doesn't 
Càtching a dub means you smoke a fat joint 
It's extreme 
I wonder if destler denies geeds to work under him
Ohhhhhh
Hahaha yeah I'm so fucked basically. Nah i don't 
"At least I'm not a gdi" -Destler @Luther Heigl 
@Charles Hem 
Destler is in a fraternity, he'll get it
I'll do it. Smash a banjo on him
Yea Charles this is gonna get crazy. Do you know what catching a dub is 
That's a joke everyone don't push over the president of the schoo 
Charles is in for a ride
I'm pumped now @Frock star 
100 points for pushing over destler! 
10 points if it's Nelson or tiger
Holy shit I'm dying
Usually the alphas or BACC throw it. And yea I do @Juan Lachapelle lol

Hahaha ehhh my dance moves would get ripped apart by black girls I'm pretty sure. They might think it's funny/cute but they're not going to wanna let me slang that
I heard if you can do the turbo hustle you get all the girls  ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) 
That's old now tho. There's a part 2 and now there's a new one 
I can dlow shuffle doe
@Charles Hem This is important. Plz rspnd 
But really, black girls get impressed if you can do all that
Lmao
@Charles Hem Sounds like I'm not being serious but I am. Can you nae nae, whip, dab, etc 
18 is old enough. Vinyl it is.

Not shocking if you seen what black girls had as options

@Charles Hem Tryna flirt with black girls? 
You guys would be surprised I've heard a LOT of black girls are super into white dudes 
Awww :/ i was about to start my afro game
Nah, black girls didn't care.
THINK OF ALL THE TINDER MATCHES 
Hahaha on black girls or every girl?
WE TOLD YOU NOT TO GET RID OF IT 
Good conversation starter
My pull game when I had my fro was ridic
Prob be disappointed when they show up and your Afro isn't the same as your pic
They're looking for some of that chocolate thunder 
Times must be tough
Just skinny ones
Thick* white girls? 
I did not put weeb on my profile, thnks
Weeb
I'm not hood enough guys
TFW you only match with white girls
Dude she's hot I'll do that the second after I consummate the marriage 
Love always wins <3 
And then on the day of your marriagr, after she never realizes that it was you from tinder, whisper "i was that guy on tinder" to see if she truly loves you enough to stay then 
Never meant to accuse you of harassment, just didn't want anyone taking it beyond a joke
I unmatched her and if I ever see her downtown or something I will do nothing but subtly bring up madden mobile 
Don't ask me how I know 
@Andrew Ward 
And it's not harassing until it's 13 messages with no response 
What @Nick DeGirolamo doesn't know won't hurt him
No my bio does not say sigma chi 
Live fast die young bad girls do it well
Nah that's Nick's turf homes
Peter loves your humor and he's alumni now, charles. Expand your horizons, see what could be ;)
I've done this many times it's ok
There's a difference between being hilarious and harassing somebody who hasn't replied
I usually like weird humor, but I always hate restraining orders
My thinking is that if I send a really weird ass joke that i think is hilarious and she doesn't get it, then oh well since I want someone who gets my weird humor anyways
@Jim Gordon Fair point
You better hope she's smart enough to figure out the joke
Jesus Christ
If I got a message like that I'd probably delete the app, hit the gym and lawyer up

Sad.
Not her can confirm 
Just checked @Luther Heigl she's at Naz 
We're not losers, we're Sigs!
I'd need to see the picture in more detail, but it totally looks like her 
Like she's been engaged for awhile and she's a p nice girl
THAT'S why she didn't reply, not because we're lame losers! Duuuh, makes so much sense
She's getting married
I really fucking hope so
Not possible

I went with "i have a small penis" theme for a while. That didn't do so hot, surprisingly

Tinder just never actually works for me, it's more about the laughs. If you don't have a car your chances of getting any girls non-rit is nonexistent 
To be fair, it didn't work well for me haha 
Hahaha strong, I like it
If they say anything other than their phone number or 0, hit me with the "command not recognized, enter phone number to continue or press 0 to discontinue"
@Charles Hem I used to ask them a series of questions (pancakes or waffles? Coffee or tea? Eggs or bacon?) in that order. At the end of it I said congratulations! Your application has been submitted to be Mike's future ex wife! To continue, enter phone number, or press 0 to discontinue. 
Please watch that video fam

Yeah I just figured it out because I remembered what it was supposed to look like at the end. It was a rough ride though

I completely forgot how to do related rates

There's tons of easy ways to not crossdress and still claim you're Beyoncé, get creative
I could give negative shits about that
Bruh I'm game for some cross dressinh
And I agree with @Pat Furrey , I ain't cross dressing. 
If anyone still cares
An idea: A white t-shirt, blue jeans and my black shoes. It fits the dress code, and it's not cross dressing. 
Okay Crawford 
🔥🔥🔥
I might as well dress up as a Nazi with how oppressing this theme is
So Im not dressing like beyonce because I am a white male and Im not cross dressing
Adnan, thats just what jess told me, maybe it was an accident. However on the theme, I do not want to cross dress. If that means I can't come I'll figure out other plans
What's the address and what time does it start?
But
I will come wearing only black form-fitting long johns and claim I'm from the single ladies music video if need be, I just need to know that's kosher
How the fuck am I going to dress like Beyoncé 
So again, how does one dress like beyonce
It's a theme party dude
Wow so many rules.

How does one dress like beyonce

No if you got uninvited, you got uninvited since you didn't respons

Buying things anonymously 
Actually...don't tell me lol
No, I get that...I'm just curious why he needs that
It's not for investing 
It's like he's going to Canada and needs so me Canadian money 
He wants to buy things anonymously on the Internet, so he's going to buy bitcoin to do that with 
sorry almost 15
also there are ~14 mil BTC in existance as of March 30th, out of the 21 mil limit
$ -> BTC in my BTC wallet -> BTC in business's BTC wallet
me <- business's goods or services
I think I'm confused what you're wanting to do
"free"
Again, that only matters if you want free money
I meant isn't most of the total sum of it already mined so it's not practical to get into now
The crypto currency day trading promise still exists and I'll extend it
That same code means I'm fucking waiting a whole day for the blockchain history to download jesus christ
The tech behind it is that you can transfer bitcoin to people completely anonymously, and it's decentralized-- no one person can control the ledger. There's fancy math and code behind that ensuring that.
Oh jesus
Chapter bitcoin tontine @Max 
Not supposed to be risky. There were massive fluctuations in exchange rate because of a boom in media attention
Also all bitcoin is mined technically. But if you want to get new BTC by mining, that's not profitable or time-effective
Yeah what's the tech behind bitcoin? The econ behind it is basically that it's progressively more expensive to produce and is risky right?
I was going to use it in exchange for goods or services, not to speculate on it
Dogecoin is best
Yes
Isn't most of Bitcoin mined? And isn't now a poor time to buy?
same. hit up riley for the econ and me for the tech

ooh now there are two sides to rip on mwahaha
I want mine to be really good parody, e.g. rips on both sides
Funny
Oh yeah that's way too heavy handed to be funng
I've heard both the things before. Interesting concept. And I wanted housing to move off campus for the longest
ew
That's got some heavy posturing in it though
op someone beat me to it https://pawprints.rit.edu/petitions/96vnAwGvYYAZDnBxA
Currently there's a realtor rating application that's in development, I believe in SG, that I will be getting involved in. I think it has potential to help chapters continue to set up off campus houses. Luther has also proposed an interesting idea to me about having certain housing be fluidly able to change from greek to non greek, and vice versa, on an as needed basis, so I'd like to flesh that idea out more with some administrators.
That
So what do you mean by "Greek housing"
Pushing for greek housing doesn't necessarily mean ask for buildings to be built. Advocacy is more complex than that @Juan Lachapelle 
"Let me manage house things. I can house more than Charles"
I'll paste my platform here.
If pat and jake actually have interest then I'm pulling out faster than a homey on father's day
Or have Ben finish picnic, and if it becomes huge we can justify it as the birthplace of a revolutionary social media experience 
Bribe a historic society 
I would still like the Chateau to become an official landmark in my lifetime
RIT has alot more things to consider than Greek houses. Student's wouldn't be happy about it either
Not if they don't find out
RIT won't stop us from building a fort in the woods right?
@Charles Hem I'm assembling a list of intents and concerns from brothers with housing manually. I'm also really trying to push for greek housing with rit administration in general. Partially mad because I didn't submit a platform, partially don't care cause I'm gonna keep doing things anyway. Do what you will young thug
So you get it automatically I would assume 
If you drop the position i s unfilled and nominations will reopen after historian elections
Didn't send 
You submitted the platform. I had mine as a draft 
I only was going to do it if no one wanted to but if jake wants it then that'd be way better
It'll be an on going cycle of no runners
Seriously though, can i do that?
Charles drops from the running, that means no house manager. Elections are held again
Yes plz
Ask a question and just read your platform instead 
Just pull a powermove and stand up to talk when it's Charles' turn. 
Gg
I had a great platform too
Honestly at this point wanting to be house manager is really all it takes
You have my vote, sharp shooter. 
Because i only kinda want it. And by that I mean i don't really want that much it but luther and merriman peer pressured me into it
Hahaha yo jake send in a platform saying I REALLY want to be house manager
Wasn't even worthy to be in charles presence 
Maybe you didn't hit send hard enough
Wait I sent one
None
I bet charles himself was a power move 
Charles only does power moves
That's a fucking power move. We call that "dropping your dick on a piece of paper and then handing it in" in the industry. 
No one else submitted a platform

Is it bad that my biggest concern out of all this is whether or not it'll raise tuition
Watch for who you don't see in SG next semester
And yes it was a response
Only a select amount of people knew about it so the leak was interesting
They were already going to announce this week but it may have been moved up after it was leaked. It wouldn't been better to get as close to being ahead of it if it was to be released early. 
It's not the professionals that you not watch out for, it's the amateurs 
So was the destler email in response to the reporter thing, because they had to address the leak?
You just have to go real RIT. Talk in obnoxious old english, refer to the anchor as good sir or M'lady, constantly bring up the idealistic 1950's and 60's. 
@Andrew Ward, right but that makes a lot of assumptions about the individual. That they will be properly and adequately trained, that they know all the laws and regulations wherever they are, that they protect and safeguard the firearm when not being used, etc.
I think I might do the car one
We should have done an interview and got real heated 
Yea, I told you they were haha
I neglected to comment
Yeah, they were all over campus
DAMN IT PETER I KNEW THEY WERE DOING INTERVIEWS 
It was with time warner, don't know who they fall under
need to see this
Its cute that news and media were all over campus yesterday. Even Max got an interview
It is a responsible gun owners duty to train himself on his weapon handling and decision making. After all, whenever a gun is discharged somebody is arrested and tried; cop and civilian all the same. I stand by what I said.
I liked teach public safety to stop mass shooters with hugs
My only issue with it is people down voting just for the sake of it. SG listens to most petitions anyway if it got decent numbers
Or maybe a "Don't Allow Cars on Campus" would be more subtle
Ugh this petition. I'm going to write a response and maybe just put it on facebook
I've mentioned it to Nathan before, and he said it'd be easy and generally people seem to support it
^ that's a petition to allow countersigning / downvoting on a petition
Well, we could do with maybe some better accountability for that stuff but yeah it's supposed to be there
https://pawprints.rit.edu/petitions/D5Sbz3tcRdkCrSJhi
Not to mention the accountability and assessment associated with being a trusted authority charged with upholding order and safety
I dont understand personal protection using guns. It's like saying I should have it as someday I would have to kill someone who would want to kill me. To me that's a bit rhetoric. idk. 
While I'm a fan of the 2A myself, theoretically a citizen would recieve far less training and have far less adequate judgement than someone whose job it is to do that
I'm not joking. Why do I need to rely on an armed SAFETY officer for my protection if I could just as easily complete training and adequate judgement in a situation which would require me to discharge a weapon.
@Andrew Ward, wait...you're joking?
I proposed campo should be equipped with lightsabers instead
Ward gonna go postal on us RIP
And that is where we go into the unpopular opinions @Andrew Ward 
ward that was the discussion point in one my CJ classes 
O wait
#gunlivesmatter
If an officer can have a gun I should be able to as well.
Mmmm. 
It's a response to the massive number of active shooters on college campuses this year
Wouldn't it be better to have it somewhere closed off by everyone other than officers in case of a crisis
I know right. what is 'protection' ? 
Why do they need guns on campus from officers? 
@Matthew Crawford 
Replace "Muslim" and "America" with "Jews" and "world" respectively. Trump pls y u speak so proud
Hey if someone else wants to make the petition I'll write it for you
He's giving a voice to angry people who aren't generally represented. 
He's a test for America and it's currently failing
Trump is straight up scary. The fact that his extremist rhetoric has supporters is really disheartening. 
Heck it could help. In the post-trump era, the most sarcastic candidate wins
^Which would benefit him if he is running in a pro-firearms district
^that could come up in the election 
attached* well maybe attacked
except my name will be attacked to it and it will be public
You're graduating soon so the fallout will be negligible
Ah, god bless bob
The other thing to remember is that it's happening regardless

Very tempted to make a parody response petition asking for a "train officers to stop active shooters with hugs" program, but I won't
Here's a rundown of it:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw4gWw915bA&sns=tw via youtube
I would advice against criticizing or supporting this until you have the full information 
If you want to let your opinions known, or learn more about this come to senate this Friday at 1
SG will have more info on Friday if interested
It's a tiny amount of trained officers
Based on my understanding, yes
Aren't the only people with firearms going to be campus safety officers?  And only a couple?  
Even as a liberal I think that's stupid 
Liberals gonna lib fam 
Shut it down omg
It begins https://pawprints.rit.edu/petitions/ifbsHHHSk7cqBYbYQ

Hahaha, rip
The "anonymous source" in the Reporter article is likely to be let go. Don't leak things.
I didn't get to read the email, I've been at the gym. I just let primal thoughts spew from my brain
That's literally the whole reason they did this, they mentioned that in the email
I honestly wasn't thinking about active shooters
Campus has to be over 65% liberal but that doesn't  mean they have to be against guns. Especially in the height of public shooters. Most people are reasonable enough to know that if all safety procedures and training is taken then it will make us overall safe. 
They'd have access to them but they wouldn't be walking around campus with them
Rifles seem excessive, but I guess I can see it. it comes down to training and whether or not they'll casually have Rifles on patrol
(Against guns) 
Tasers in response to active shooter situations hasn't been tested and RIT is doing this for risk aversion, not for experimentation
Tasers are hella ineffective 
Still don't know why they need anything more than a taser to fulfill their duties
Apparently some would have rifles or shotguns 
I'm very excited 
I am excited for the liberal contingent of campus to protest this
I doubt they'll be anything other than standard issue pistols
The firearms could have no more than 10 rounds 
All I can say for sure is that it's a buffer until the MCS gets here
Which is why I would like to know how well officers are going to be trained, I don't think anybody wants to see an unfortunate occurrence happen to one of our peers, especially if it could've been prevented entirely by proper training
I maybe took it the wrong way but the way I look at it, that person or people could be anyone of us or our peers
Of course, but that doesn't mean I'm not going to make jokes about it
I always am @Experienced Person #2 
It might be prudent to hold judgement until we all know what we're talking about
No, but they also haven't told us any of that. It's reasonable to be suspicious of it 
You're familiar with the officers, the training regime, and the training organization?
Because I honestly don't put my confidence in the quality of training these officers are going to go through
Is anyone interested in getting involved in SG?
Destler just sent an email about it
Wait why do they need guns 90% of their job is to break up parties and 10% is to ride around on segways  
And why would you joke about that?

5pm. Pro-consul folder
Hey, when are the platforms due again and where are the references (past platforms we can look at)?
I forgot a bunch of periods but maybe you'll get the point. Side note, I found where the flies were coming from and I have disposed of the source. It was an open container of hummus in the kitchen shelf. Used my vacuum to suck the little fuckers. Let them free into the wild to roam and shit.
But shoving letters down their throat as soon as they begin orientation isnt the best because that draws more of a "my OA seems real chill. Their fraternity will be chill AF" and we shouldn't be looking into it like that giving them a tease and influencing to do their homework makes the freshmen know that we aren't the stereotypical greek life on campus. 
Its like "hey I'm part of this club and this club" that's how we may or may not be perceived as a "club". Its an interest group in a sense.
Super late to the party. OAs should be able to let their students aware of Greek organizations and say that they're Greek. However, it should be vague since having a direct influential connection to a freshman straight to your organization is a little iffy. I still say Greeks should totally be able to check out Greek life and give them a little tease saying "if you go to this event, you'll see me with my letters and we can definitely talk about"
you kids taking initiative, makes this 'ol pappy so proud
Ok thanks juan
*reach out
Not really, each out to IFC through email or tell your IFC delegate (still James) to bring it up as a discussion point during a general meeting
Roberts
Sorry if this is an incredibly studied question but how do I bring it up to the councils like are there certain rules I need to follow
Bring it up to the councils and start some dialogue to see if others feel the same. Get some clarification from the OA office about the policy on Greeks then work to see if a compromise can be made.
Juan if we wanted to fix this how would we do it and what's the best way to go about it?
3 years with last year as a lead
Well, its a thing and has been for my time as an oa
I should do research and see if this is a thing on other campuses
I'm sorry but I honestly can't see a single reason for that to be the case 
Other clubs and organizations are fine but Greeks just can't disclose themselves currently
But there's a good chance that if you're on the team you were recruited.
The answer is no for sports.
Only Greeks have a restriction that we are told during training
As far as I know, no
If your on a sports team are you under the same regulations? 
If a freshman came up to you and wanted more information on Greek life and possibly your organization, you can disclose that
Greeks are already super involved in orientation
My discussions were based around the idea that you have a captive audience that you could obvious just promote yourself and push your group
I don't see a problem with more Greeks being active in orientation. Seems like a great thing to me. 
No i was just wondering us all
^ that would incentivize more chapters to push brothers to be involved in orientation too. If you want the best opportunity to get to men first you have to be active. 
Please don't, but it happens
And during orientation week, everything is on lockdown. Everyone gets a chance to recruit for their clubs during the get involved fair
As an oa can you invite them to parties? 
I will
How so?
Bring it up to IFC. And that's a separate situation
I don't really see a problem with it. If an incoming freshman is interested in Greek life and the OA is a member, why wouldn't they be able to say they should rush and meet the guys?
I wanna be able to recruit literally as soon as I'm on campus. 
Just saying
They don't hate Greek life and many of the upper staff are greek
But like I said, if you disagree, talk to IFC and get clarification from the OA staff
I can only see it as a way to avoid pushing recruitment to freshman before the get involved fair. 
Links*
Group recruitment gives weak leaks opportunities they would not have in a natural environment. I agree with Ward. 
I'll write out my opinions more comprehensively and organized later
I still don't get the reasoning for that. 
I don't like group recruitment. I'd much rather some competition for recruitment be won at the job interview. After all, if we are the best, we'd just be screwing ourselves at first pick.
And no one knows or cares about IFC/CPC at that stage
An OA can state the clubs and stuff they are in but not the Greek affiliation they have
No OA should say I'm in x organization join! Every OA should say I'm in IFC/CPC, stop by one of our info sessions! 
That's a good opinion, let IFC know about so we can do something about it. 
An OA should be able to talk about the organization's they're in and tell the incoming freshmen about them
That's what the staff wants to avoid
That's ridiculous in my humble opinion. 
But you just can't push recruitment on your oas
Of course it still happens, it did with me
But they can say they are in Greek life
OAs are not allowed to state their affiliation
The OA staff can't recruit just as much as any other club.
So if he was that would be wrong?
He's not Greek though 
At least at RIT
But, you can easily be friends with freshman and meet them at the get involved fair
The reason I heard of sigma chi was through my OA. 
CPC recruitment is so short because it makes is really hard to recruit outside of the events
I disagree Juan. The group exists, but the term group isn't the right word. They're not all together, yet.
OAs can say they are in Greek life but cannot actively recruit people
I disagree and its not true
Orientation staff should be allowed and encouraged to push greek life in general
A formal recruitment environment actually encourages much more ferocius competition
First step is to remove the idea that there is this small group of guys that people recruit (doesn't exist)
Why do we need a community feel? At the end of the day we want the best men and no one else is going to get em. 
The current system encourages ferocious competition. Although it may improve quality, there is no community feel during recruitment
I still would like to do something during orientation before I graduate. We only have the get involved fair and our tiny info session
And some others tosses around the idea as well.
An open event is an idea I tossed around But I'd still like it to be Greek wide. IFC only wouldn't be a terrible idea
Hence the twist, make it beach day-ish
And for fraternites, we don't have this group of "recruits" everyone pools from. We find people and invite them to our events
RIT students don't want to join Greek life. Our job is to convince them otherwise. A fair isn't terribly effective in that regard
I feel
I think if the ifc rush period was used properly, my problem would be fixed. A short period where all fraternities have a chance to make first impressions. Recruits are encouraged to make the rounds, pick a few they like, and then go to actual fraternity rush events. 
It would be the same sort of environment as the SAU about a week ago 
And in the case of the idea I had, since it was a "Greek" event, if everyone wasn't for it then I wasn't gonna organize it
And that's not the case
They don't want great ideas ok let them do them
And doing a fair in our environment wouldn't work. That would suggest people are actively looking to join groups here
IFC can do it. Fuck the sororities.
That's been talked about and discussed a few times. Many of which I brought ideas up that people brought down (mainly from the sorority side)
Creating structure though, possibly a Greek Rush fair or something out on the Greek lawn that has most organizations present and we do something fun like a beach days thing
Some fraternities in other colleges do formal 
Not formal rush. The way the sororities do it is possibly one of the oddest things about greek life 
I was in class but this is a good discussion
Th e way I see it is that if we do add new organizations and go the survival of the fittest route which I think is fine the problem would be that a good number of organizations would then fail and I think that reflects poorly on rits greek life as a whole
There's some benefit to formal recruitment but in our current state i don't think it's worth it
It would probably be super stressful since we have so many groups and totally wreck the number of guys who give it a chance, but I sorta like how sororites do it
#AddSomeCommonStructureToRush maybe
srsly I can't handle it
#ShortenRush
#ExtendRush
I think I agree with Pat. Out of all the fraternities we have, I feel like people would find their place in one of them. The bigger problem is that people don't find which one they fit into best because it's hard to meet every group and get to know them
Somebody read this conversation to Matt guys....
I'm one of the newest members so granted I have the least information on greek life but I think we're working with a very limited population of potential Greeks and the only way to increase the number of potentials is by making greek life as a whole seem better so it makes sense to me to dedicate our resources to improving existing chapters, I am genuinely curious as to what adding new chapters will do since I honestly have no idea
When everyone is forced to focus on quantity instead of quality they all suffer
That works to some extent but at some point you force chapters to appeal to the masses rather than a specific type of person that fits in with the chapter.
Simply put I believe more competition will drive up quality and cause weaker organizations to move on/adapt
#FratLivesMatter
I think addressing the stereotypes is important in order to eliminate/disprove them.
I think this is a problem because potential male Greeks are deterred by not meeting a chapter they could fit in with. I think the argument could be extended that less perfect matches occur when people settle in terms of picking a chapter. For example, there may be a new greek rn who is less thrilled with his decision, would've made a great member of another organization, but was never made aware of the other organization's presence
There are so many fraternity chapters on campus that I doubt the average recruit could accurately gauge what all of them have to offer in one rush period.
This prevents chapters from dying out. That also comes st a price for a lot of Greek organizations to up their recruitment not for the sake of keeping their chapter alive but finding the right people through strong genuine recruitment 
Personally I feel like we are slightly rushing in accepting the chapters. Which is great because there's a another Greek organization to be recognized. However, after the NMI, it is true where we are similar in many ways, where the ritual is what clearly defines us. I feel like people can actually meet the current existing organizations to at least give them an opportunity to meet them and for that organization to meet them. 
There are 5 chapters less than 6 years old
I think we're accepting too fast. There's still not enough support ad facilities for greek life as it stands. Adding more imo leaves room for failure and greek life to be destroyed kn campus for shit people do. Currently there are at least 4 fraternities and sororities under 10 years old in ifc and mgc that I know of. There's not enough time to prove that they aren't solid and robust from failure
Stereotypes exist. I'm not going to say what they are because theyre mostly inaccurate and not well developed
I heard they have their own chapter geed. That's sick
Well there's this amazing one on campus called sigma chi and I honestly think they're just the best fraternity out there and the chapter on campus is the greatest of all sigma chi chapters but that's just my totally in biased opinion 
Because there's a few that i know nothing about
Put it on your resume and be like Jordan and love your organization to death if you're cradling it to its chartering 
This is kind of just a separate question, but is there a sort of general opinion about every fraternity already here on campus? I know that sort of thing is usually not accurate but I'm still curious what the stereotypes are, if there are any
And not putting it on a resume as "founder of ____"
I feel like chapters who are trying to charter, hell even colonize has to take it serious and not doing it for shits and giggles
Oh not at all I worded my question horribly so that's on me lol
Sorry if that was harsh Matt, its a good question
And new chapters come about due to: chapters who were gone who alumni want it to be back, people who just want to start something new since, none of the current chapters fit peoples style
I'm just asking lol, the Greek population of rit is really small but we do have good fraternities on campus imo, so I dont understand what's to gain from adding new chapters   like why is that a goal instead of working on the ones we currently have 
To answer your question Matt, more chapters means more diversity and a higher chance of an individual finding a chapter that fits them. Also, if chapters don't want to grow past a certain size it is the only way we can grow as a community
Poor wording but its the mentality I was questioning
everyone give the pope some space
Yes, that person is Eric Pope
Everyone give Matt some space, he's more powerful than we realize
One person has the power to prevent a whole chapter from coming about? Holy crap
I have no problem with expansion. I just think we're doing it too quickly right now
Matt, if you asked that question 5 years ago, we wouldn't be here
11 and with DSP, 12
What's the point of having new chapters? -Genuinely curious
We have what, 13?
Well, that's something
Do it 
This will be discussed in IFC next semester but how do people feel about our current expansion status? (Allowing new chapters to come to RIT)
To be fair, so is 99% of everyone involved in the NFL
Just asked the pope, he told me that the pats are going to hell

Did you know that every team did the same type of videotaping and the actual rule the pats broke was they videotaped from the wrong spot 
What do you know about spygate
All the pats cases(emphasis on plural) in the 21st century ate organization based and seems to fall under the "15 consecutive winning seasons" you previously mentioned 
Same tier 
= video taping other team
your right Eli is a fucking cheat for ensuring that he wasn't going to be drafted by the chargers 
Eh I'm too lazy
Did you guys even read half these gates? A lot of these are individual things..
That's much worse 
Yes but patriots cheat as an organization not individuals 
No they had a video camera.
The patriots have a cheat code and his name is belichick
Seems like a joke of a website
Your giants are at #5
Yeah I was gonna link that site next 
Lololol the pats are listed as below average cheaters in the NFL http://yourteamcheats.com/cheaters/
Being totally sarcastic it's the fucking ny times haha
Patriots actually cheated but they escaped with no suspension.still got fined by nfl for cheating 
http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2015/02/04/if-the-patriots-cheated-theyre-hardly-alone/
But don't take them as the word of god on everything
Among most newspapers, they are highly regarded
Awk...not the cover of time magazine...is the New York Times reputable?
http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/06/sports/football/06patriots.html?_r=0
I think it's funnier that they did it ..and not like the bucs
Against nfl regulations? What rule? 
Source? Can't find one
They were caught and penalized for pumping in crowd noise, you just don't read about that on the cover of Time 
Only time colts probably cheated was flunking all the games to get #1 draft pick aka Andrew luck 
But plz let us drink your tears 
Teams cheat alllll the time in the NFL
Colts pumped in crowd noise 
Replace " fuck Colgate " with "fuck patriots"? 
So what Im getting out of this is that we're gonna start watching soccer. Go Chelsea!!
Also the pats get accused of cheating, get investigated, and have nothing suspicious found all the time. Maybe it's because theyre not cheating
I'm done with this argument. If your argument is that other teams get away with shit cause they are not as good as the pats...you fail the grasp that your organization has a history of cheating. Ignore that if you may, but no matter how many wins your team gets..most people will not be able to see past the blackening from the dishonor
The Bengals and cardinals don't have 15 consecutive winning seasons
The pats actually requested to have the locker room sweeped again after each game so they couldn't be framed but their request was denied
Idt everyone hates the bengals or the cardinals just cause they are good
Sad that they have to get that done 
The pats get their away team locker room sweeped for bugs pretty much every week. They have yet to find any bugs
When you're team is good people start looking for reasons to hate them and start making shit up so they can blame that instead of their team for being bad
And rightfully so that the pats get more press...they've built that rep...just like anything suh does will be criticized 
An yes I did
Dirty player vs dirty organization 
Let's take Talib poking someone in the eye after a play was over a few weeks ago. Did you even know that happened?
If other teams did..the team that they faced would not be okay with it...
...no. 
Other teams do things but only the pats make headlines
The problem is that no other team would do that 
It just happens to be that the pats constantly do this.. Your defense is invalid
About them Yankees thoooo
It's against the rules..so yeah people woul care
If any other team did it no one would have given a shit but since it was the pats its headline news for months
Still was against regulations m8
Cause his phone happened to be broken? 
Not only was it proven that the deflation had little to no effect on the outcome but it was also proven that Brady was not responsible
Also^ with that statement... Oj Simpson is totally innocent 
Spygate
The fact that there even is a "last time" 
When is the last time we were actually convicted for cheating? Deflategate doesn't count because that was appealed
Tell Brady to Take his ugg boots and shove it
Or cheat more. 
Also as a giants fan..I can root against them whenever #nfc
There's so much hate for us, and it only makes us stronger
Again as a person you're great, nfl wins fuck you 
Id be so disgraced as a pats fan 
Ask any other fan. They'll tell you you're all the worst 
Being a pats fan is great. Just ask a pats fan
My entire country would hate me and the only thing to hold on to are the wins that were won by cheating 
I love how the patriots are in a position where just about everyone has to root for them unless they're playing against them to have the best chance at making the playoffs
That's not true. I would hate to be a patriots fan.
They hate us because they anus
But if you were us you would love us
We don't hate you because we ain't you, we just hate you

Buffalo is playing much better tha the Patriots right now. They just suck, so it's tied
The Patriots signed a deal with the devil for this
*watching game with father and ball hits post* " well that's a buffalo move if I've ever seen one"

Just use solo cups instead of styrofoam and paper?! Win win. 
Google styrofoam vs paper cups
There's no way it's greener 
When you reuse styrofoam let me know. 
Reusing styrofoam? Clean it and reuse it. Yes paper will eventually degrade but it costs so much to make... You use so much more resources to make a paper product that you can argue that styrofoam has a lesser impact and is more green than paper
They're more bio degradable than styrofoam and not necessarily. How do you recycle styrofoam?
Most paper products aren't biodegradable an end up just sitting in a landfill. Theoretically styrofoam should be reused instead of a 1 and done deal.
Styrofoam isn't reusable @Justin E 
@Luther Heigl Those are interesting. Gonna eat but then researching some and let's hash this out. I've been fed some shady info so id like to straighten it up
I don't recycle. Fite mi
It's a contributing factor, but nowhere near the level you're saying 
Gladiator is one of the fratiest movies on the planet. 
Carnivores do help, but 7 billion potential carnivores don't help the planet 
There more under inventory of us greenhouse gas emissions and sinks
Mike you are very wrong about methane. 
www3.epa.gov/climatechange/ghgemissions/gases/ch4.html
Styrofoam costs less resources than paper. Take a cup example... A paper cup requires more petroleum than a styrofoam cup 
In retrospect, eating animals is all the same. Whether they are pets or not
I fart sometomes. So do fish, maybe. As do horses, but I don't eat horse. Or dog. Or cat. I'm decent
Carnivores help. Kill the animals to prevent cows farting killing the environment 
Basically
But have fun mandating that globally 
Unfortunately what I'm saying is less people less problems 
No carnivore 
Lol no
We need to go vegan
So what you are saying is
Quick fix tho have a garden, and eat squirrels 
The output of methane gas from the food industry has already, or is about to, surpass the amount of global travel combined 
No it's not.... There's more to climate change than fuel. Our food industry is slowly killing the planet, and when you eat meat (let's go with beef for one example), there's a whole chain. One, cows fart and produce methane, which is worse than carbon in terms of greenhouse gases. So think about how much beef is made readily available in this country alone. Then think about that you have to feed cows, but these massive farms import their grains, so there's burnt fossil fuels in transportation to the methane producing cows. And that's just beef, not poultry or pork too. (Hint, pigs and chickens fart too)
Unpopular opinion: styrofoam is better for the environment than paper 
Essentially 
Bomb everyone
So what your saying is
It's the countries that are industrializing. The USA actually is decreasing it's footprint ..it's the countries that need to rely on cheap fuels(coal) that are going to shaft the world. But who are we to tell these countries to go fuck themselves and that they can't develop. 
Obliteration of continents is now an essential human right and a luxury
Fucking colgate

Yeah. Fuck people trying to be developed and have the same luxuries Americans have deemed as essential to human rights

Lol it's most developed countries @Justin E 
Who doesn't want an elephant in your room?
Or rather, having a population as large as we do
Sorry Mike. I'm stop eating and fix the overpopulation of humans issue. Good bye loved ones
I'm not good with words sometimes @Juan Lachapelle  contribute lol
And overpopulation causes a shit ton of issues. Elephant in the room
And poor sustainable programs for food, not to mention other things 
We actually aren't te issue (usa) nor china! It's actually the countries trying to become more developed 
Not being pessimistic, just looking at facts the way they are right now 
I don't know if donate is the right word
Because overpopulation 
Fun fact when you eat meat you donate to global climate change 
I see the world going to hell in the next 5-10 years (regardless whether we have a republican or democrat)
Haha, I can't actually do it. I was fucking with you, @Justin E 
Many South American countries near the Andes only get 2 seasons..winter and summer. Now they are noticing  a longer summer...you might say "hey but they get more time to grow crops" wrong. It leads to an increase in pests..poor soil. And a redrawing of the climate regions.
Most things I've seen point to about 2050+ where things will start going to real shit
And non believers 
Oh? 
Said republicans 
There's little conclusive science to prove its real
Get heated! @Justin E

Haha I'm sorry for ranting Mike. We recently did market concentration and cornot-nash equilibrium in one of my classes and I wanted to take it for a spin. I definitely agree that R&D promotes innovation and innovation leads to tons of really cool shit(mainly money). 
^that's not completely true
True, for all we know we're out of oil tomorrow and the world falls into anarchy 
I mean maybe 10+ years down the line sure but I don't think anyone here is knowledgable/talented enough to know a none-existing  market concentration and marginal cost functions. 
I mean I don't think anyone would argue against that. I'm just saying other energy sources will not be cheaper by any means. 
Research and development is necessary for any type of progress though. Think long run not current. Without R&D the world would be much different. Nothing starts at its full potential. 
Good to know buddy, hoping other people get experiences like that
It was for an early argument and it forgot to delete it haha 
Ditch that second part
Research and development is expense and time consuming. Those expenses will be past onto the consumer raising prices.  Also if that was the case cost of oil would rise because more firms would be competing for less market control. 
We could also pump R&D for renewable energy sources, making them cheaper and more efficient--->more competition for oil and prices go down. Can't get a way with not using oil though because it's in everything 
Alright but you got his name so that's something

Is Canada foreign petrol or just crude oil? I didn't think we took much processed material. We prefer to process crude oil in the United States as we have different regulation and minimum grade allowed. 
Largest source of our gas comes from my after a good day at chipotle extra beans
Our largest source foreign petrol imports is Canada too
Fun fact out of the United States' total imports the Saudi's only make up less than 15%. The U.S also out produces the Saudi's in barrels per year.

Wellness classes are for pussies 
Dodgeball
Kayaking, fencing, and soccer 
As for my online class tirade, those are all electives. Last things I have left for my major is literally my thesis
Depending on whether you use old sis or tiger center, there are search options for specific requirements
I like to dance so I just take dancing classes. 
I've got a ton of freshman questions today but what were some of yalls favorite wellness courses? Also, how do you search for artistic general education perspectives?

4 online classes, 1 Tues/Thurs class. 
Whitewater is probably outside, but you'll need to pass a skill test 
But yeah kayaking rocks
Seriously, even whitewater kayaking and outdoor rockclimbing? 
3 online classes and 2 classes on tues / Thurs. God bless
Kayaking is also a shitload of fun
Kayaking is indoors except for a trip at the end, and rock climbing would be in the red barn 
So I wouldn't hate myself if I signed up for an outdoor kayaking or rock climbing class?
It warms up, and if it's super cold they'll try to do it indoors 
In the beginning
Are all the spring outdoor wellness classes cold as hell?

I wasn't speaing just for phi delt. I think an organization lacking in unity would do just as poorly
ΣΧ >ΦΔΘ
Well phi delt has great brotherhood, they just dont have the commitment to ritual to push them in a positive direction
I'd say all of RBC constitutes the purpose
We'll unfortunately have a point in our history like that
The more you drift from your ritual aka purpose the more issues you'll have
Organizations ebb and flow
Aepi loses house, phidelt goes under membership review, meanwhile < 10 yr old chapters are killing it
Whether it's for better or for worse is yet to be determined
Based on what Eric Pope has said about their HQ, I think the chapter will survive
And that's if their chapter survives this. 
#prayforphidelt
Based on what I've seen, they really needed a wake up call and are responding to it very well so far. Of course we won't be able to see the long term effects until at least next year
Poor chaps. Hopefully they don't lose too many guys and this is the kick in the nuts they need to get their shit together 
It's just a long list of minor violations combined with not being a contributing member of the community
I never said I was an informed authority, but I knew 2 pledges when I pledged and they were hazed
But that was my frosh year
 they had issues with alcohol/weed violations iirc
It's not hazing
 It goes way way beyond hazing
^you don't know that
Hazing probably
I think of it like a disease. One person isn't really worthy of being initiated then they recruit more people like them and their standard is lowered. Then this shit happens 
What have they been doing?
For the ones who tried, props to them. At least they took it serious
Pretty much
Bingo
IMO its the chapters fault for not keeping their brothers in check. 
They messed up for years and this is the consequence. And it was a sanction
*sanction
It was a sancrion
jesus Christ. Why risk that for yourself
Fuck
And if its determined that they need to go they either go to early alumni status or lose their membership
A membership review is basically 1 step below losing your charter
Phi Delt has their HQ here interviewing each member
The chapter
HOLY
Membership meaning IFC? Or CPC also?
Basically HQ comes down and kicks out a portion of your chapter
Oooo god
If your chapter is going through membership review, you are in the wrong place
Tldr Juan plox
No, they put themselves in this place

Yo real talk I don't really care about fundraisers I just really like Buffalo Wild Wings. I think I've gotten take out from there like 8-10 times this semester with no regret 
There's like a million of them this week.
what's with the sudden interest in going to fundraisers? I've seen posts for a bunch of them but this is the first time I've seen anyone want to go
totally forgot this chat existed cuz I muted it

Remember that full body shots will make you look real tiny. Its a composite at the end of the day

You can do better than that ward
If its covered enough, I'll pass it

WHAT IF I PUT A BOW TIE ON MY FROCK

Just no dick unless its clothed. All other nudity is ok
Ariel you've been pledging my frock from the beginning. 
Whatever you want it be, I really don't care
Juan can my picture just be like a petri dish with mononucleosis
And everyone's pictures won't be shown until the  final reveal
You got a lot of time for ideas, I'm making the template over winter break
I think I rather pledge triangle than pledge to your frock, ward.
My frock is sacred. I can't let unworthy eyes bask in its glory without adequate preparation.
Basically there's a pledging period to see my frock.
We want it tasteful folks
Everything but dick would be kosher for me. 
Depends on if it's cut or uncut 
On the nudity
This is Hutu radio reminding you not to trust the Tutsi cockroaches.

They are saying that whoever is behind it is pretty well trained though which makes it even scarier 
Borders have been closed and army dispatched
No, no one has been identified
I only saw this briefly today.. Do they know who is behind it yet? 
It must be incredibly scary to be there right now. Hopefully the police and government can calm things down so more innocent life is not taken 
Oh shit
Its happening in multiple locations

Think of it as a lot of powerful, influential people using their skills, resources, and networks to advance the interests of RIT
They are adding the bylaw to allow an SG member to be on the board of trustees as we speak
They focus on fundraising a lot and advocate for RIT
That's only one part of it
The involvement is in the context of student affairs and issues
Ooo okay nvm I was confused 
And many of them live far away
That
They are involved, more so at a higher level. 
Is there a reason why trustees aren't involved?
25 of them are local though
Ah crap peters never leaving us 
I know one that I can ask
Frankly, I'm not sure I they'd go
Does that mean Peter can be an advisor when he's a trustee!!!!! 
Peter, do you know about the possibility to have a trustee as an advisor? Since they are rarely on campus, I don't know if this is effective but I want to know if its possible
Peter Ryan changed name to Peter Ryan, Jr.
Yo if I was a trustee my motto would be "yo fuck students get monii" cuz thats how I live my life 
It has a degree of truth to it though
Saying that they're disconnected 
Resent putting a student on the board or them governing without student representation?
As a possible future trustee I resent that
The trustees are often disconnected with how students work and what they do so this is huge
And they are learning about SG and to decide whether to let a student serve on the board
But what's being discussed 
I'm gonna streak it
Board of trustees is here for the first time in years, doctor destler is in attendance and so is sandy johnson
Board of Trustees and destler is attending 
Why
Give us the scoop juan
This is literally the most important SG meeting since I've been a student and maybe all time
And shit reality TV shows
Three points.  one, I take a short 2 hour nap and I miss 100 messages holy smokes. Two, that picture of me and that cat made me squeal like a little girl I don't even give a fuck. Three, NJ hate makes actually no sense. It's literally just farmers and NYC commuters(at least in my area) 
Wait Italians aren't from jersey shore? TIL

I'll bow down to having the most Italian American Italian Americans
@Michael Lutfring  They probably thought of jersey shore and Olive Garden.
Yea she can get this work
Jwoow was from near albany
Will do @Luther Heigl .
The problem is most Italian Americans are not like the movies. 
I mean most Italian Americans I met spoke Italian pretty fluently 
@Grant Scheynost 
Grant, ask one of them how they feel about losing to a country that's losing to starvation 
The fuck you talking about grant 
Wait no, she's like Portuguese, adopted into a Greek family, and pretending to be Italian 
She went to college? 
I would think again, all of the Italians I spoke to here described the American Italian culture fake AF
But she's Greek so it's ok 
To one of our acquaintances...😑
Yeahhh
To our high school 
She even has connections to Saugerties 
Fuckkkkkkkk

We'll that is incredibly false

Yeah but that makes the rest of the North the losers 
NJ is north of the mason-Dixon line so we are already winners ❤️

I'm too used to seeing them lmao
Whoops
No it's illegal to own them too
People make their own AR's up here 
Yeah I'm pretty sure it just prevented the sale of them
Random note not that most people care, board of trustees will be at SG today
Yea nobody registers their illegal weapons 
Hid*
Yeah my Grandad had a bunch that became illegal because they were "bulk loaded". I think he just had them
💁🏻
Charles more south? 
Ward is so not south 
💁🏼
Ward will go all south on us. 
Reasons New York blows 
I didn't say federally lol
NY safe act 
Not federally.
I just added rifles and bows because upstate 
Most AR's are, a lot of scopes are
Yea we have the woods. Central park. Duh
Those aren't illegal...
Get the military. Rednecks are ALLLLLLLLLLLLL ABOUT their AR's and scopes and rifles, and bows. And they all hunt. Do people in the city have rifles and the ability to stalk in the woods? 
Fight me. Oh wait you're not here. Default win for me guys. 1-0
Still have shit pizza and crap Italian food. #OLIVEGARDEN
Upstate New York, land of the free and home of the illegal weapons 
It was a typo 
S A V A G E
They can't even make it across a lake 
Bunch of refugees, I'm terrified
James will arrive, speak of how we all suck, and retake our land 
Lol
James will bring all of EU together. We're done 
I'm in the middle of class trying my hardest not to laugh right now
It doesn't end well. 
It won't be a pretty sight
@James Buxton 
Don't start pissing off drunk rednecks with full military grade arsenals in their backyards
What if I get blood on my crisps
Holy crap mike
People are gonna think things about me
You made me laugh in the bathroom
Fucking crisps
>crisps
Lmao crisps
We have a lot of expendable young black folk with dreams of being gangster
Lmao I can't stop laughing 
"Crisps"
And the bloods and crisps? They got their own problems 
Mobbed? You think Italians are gonna attack Saugerties? Most of the town is Italian and related, and then related to the city in some aspect 
Causal > Mild > Pretty Racist
It's not like terribly racist there, it's just mild 
Eventually 
You have no clue how quickly NYC will be mobbed up. Maybe a few stabs from rival gangs but we'll unite
You guys aren't in liberal territories anymore 
Not even by Luther or myself just the town in general
You have no clue how quickly a militia will be formed 
Damn Socrates. 
I'm gonna invade Socrates and culturally enrich you all
Take over Socrates ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Good, stay down in NYC. I don't want randos in my hometown 
Upstate 😂😂😂
Guess where all those actors in those movies live...
And European standards of beauty while we're at it
Yea we aren't all violent and shit. Maybe on Fridays 
Because movies 
To be fair, blame movies and media
OOOO ARIEL
There's a reason people only think of the city when people say New York, just saying
Bby*
Yus ty vby
You loyal
Juan I'll wait one year and then shave your Afro if you keep talking that nonsense 
You smart
Whoever mentioned halal street food though
What's an upstate?
Fight me
Upstate is garbage
Pretty simple
No Greg 
Why can't everyone just agree that upstate is superior? 
It's basically a pizza but for you and better than pizza
You guys say "Hoagie" too, right?
It sounds like pizza overcompensating for it's shittyness
Which is already retarded in the first place 
That sounds like a heart attack 
Long Island is known for being the retarded cousin of Jersey 
Long island is known for Jones beach, not no damn bagels 
Anyone here ever have a pizza fry????
Luther you heretic
No you don't 
Fuck off Luther 
We have better pizza shush
Nooooo 
Chicago, baby
Except we do tho
Imma let you finish but Long Island has the greatest bagels of all time
You've never been to village pizza 
HA
HA
HA 
At least we have better pizza
 ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
wraps, burgers, homemade cream cheeses, best bacon
Nope 
NYC bagels better. *waits for rant*
3 dollars gets you so much candy, a bagel with cream cheese. 
They have TE BEST BAGELS YOU WILL EVER EAT
You can get Lox on your bagel, but there's so much more
Bodega's are only good for snacks
They have lox but no one gets it 
Lox of Bagels
It's called lox of bagels 
If you ain't got bodegas..... Damn
Like salmon lox? 
The second I saw wegmans, I realize how garbage our grocery places were
Also fucking Lox, yes
Lmao they do....
Nah, bro. I'm talking hole in the wall Chinese place. 6 seats total. 
Shit's dope as fuck. 10$ for like a pound of meat and rice and a can of soda, so good
NYC grocery places suck, don't front
But do you have a met/key food?
I prefer the family places near me. Cheap, huge portions and delicious
BUT DOES ANYONE ELSE HAVE A LOX I DIDNT FUCKING THINK SO 
Panda express is everywhere in NYC
Get out of here 
@Luther Heigl 
Free food if you wear orange to the hockey game tonight
Dragon city for life 
Oh my God. We have the greatest Chinese place back home. I'd literally give my first born to Ming Wok
Country*
Halal food from the streets. 
I don't like what's happening to me 
The Chinese food around here isn't the same
On the way there I listened to Courtney and wore flannel 
And chinese food. As bad as it is for you
2 Bros Pizza blessed pizza joint 
I went to a tractor supply company looking for an off-road vehicle
#godbless
Dollar pizza, $2.50 for 2 slices and a can of coke 
I'm gonna go buy a tractor 
Don't forget about Soho with the man hair buns, 16 year old sneakerheads, kanye wannabes
It's the country in ourselves @Luther Heigl 
To be fair I've never liked any city though 
Manhattan, big lights, big dreams, times square, expensive stores, Broadway
I've never liked NYC when I've been there
So anywhere Saugerties up on both sides of the river to Albany 
What was special about the city anyways? 
The magic of NYC is gone to me. The place is a shitshow
Idk about @Luther Heigl but on multiple occasions people have confused Saugerties with Socrates 
"I'm from the city" 
"Oh how's times square?"
"Oh I mean I'm from NYC and I live in Brooklyn"
"Huh?"
But if you go 30 minutes to Rhinebeck you get upper middle class and famous actors
Like the other boroughs don't exist
Most people just think of Manhattan anyway when they think of NYC
Go to palenville and you get sister mothers 
Far*
The things I didn't know 
Go fat enough into the mountains and you get Adirondack hill people 
Pretty accurate Jake
Hispanics , foreign people
Yea you have rednecks hipsters ghetto (fake) and ghetto (real) white bread people uncooked rice people regulars 
When you live in NYC, when you say "do you wanna go to 'the city' ",  you mean Manhattan. When you leave NYC, and say you're from the " the city" you mean all 5 Boros not Manhattan 
Saugerties is literally just a mix of every possible culture. It's super weird 
Jamaica ave is usually referred to "the ave" 
Idk, we're not toooooo far from the city only like 2 hours. 
How does that happen, did you just get people who migrated from the city?
"Its mad cold" "he mad stupid"
Yup we do mad too. Basically Saugerties has city slang 
Using mad in the context of severity, not actually mad 
That's a favorite for me too mike
None
Is bogey or loosie a thing up here?
The biggest one for us back home is "OD" in stead of saying too much 
Not a full list but gives a good idea
http://spoilednyc.com/2015/03/17/33-nyc-slang-words-every-new-yorker-know-learn/2/
Around where I went to school, we use "grizz" for a girl who looked ugly AF that day. 
I say "it's cold as fuck"
I've said it like that up here before and gotten some weird looks 
Yea we do that at home 
In NYC, we use "brick" or "brick city" to say that its cold
Like what 
Same
There are a lot of slang words I can't use at RIT because people would get confused
Now you are hip
Thanks for the slang word of the day
If you try to attract someone with the hopes of intercourse, but they do not want to have the relations and they blow you off, or give you the run around conversation tactic, they are sleeping on you 
Good morrow ladies
Mornin
Hush. Sleep young riley. You need rest
Good morning sweet bbg's :* 
That was just more slang 
None
Like when a girl is ignoring  your efforts to touch or she's Hittin you with a mean curve, she's sleepin on you.
No lol 
riley needs some slang education
Ohhhh. Thats hip. I'm going to start using that. Yo prof sorry I bombed your exam I was just sleepin' on you 
Ignoring lol. Like if I slept on you that means that I didn't pay attention to you. 
Team Ana homie. And what the hell does "sleepin on" mean lol 
I'm just saying didn't like Ana. Whole movie she was also sleepin on kristoff. 
We learn and grow. Ana realized that she rushed her decision to get married to the jerk. To put the whole thing on Ana is silly. You can't hold one person responsible for how another reacts. Textbook victim blaming breh. Tl;Dr Ana was a naive kid but she learned from her mistakes  and fought tooth and nail, risking her life, to rescue her sister that she loved deeply. 
@Michael Lutfring is phired up
It's not like they were alone in the castle by themselves. Clearly there were other people there other wise they would succumbed to an untimely demise. Elsa was fucked up because her parents told her she couldn't touch anyone, not that she should learn it. Also that she was a freak and shouldn't tell anyone. Ana just had a dysfunctional older sister and was a typical younger child. The movie was an inspiration Austin don't you dare 
You do remember they were slaved within their castle. Never going outside for easily a decade. So their social skills were fairly childish. The movie was p dumb
He he "snowballing" 
didn't get her way so she cried. I don't fuck with that 
BRAT
Ana was a spoiled 
She was dumb and wanted to get married with else's blessing, Elsa said no and provide good reasoning as to why they shouldn't, and then Ana got panties in a bunch and cried like a brat. Snowballing to her saving elsa
No because Elsa was too spooked with her powers. Think about the ice cream she could have gave to her town. All the kids grew up without ice cream. Do you want that for children??
She became a popsicle. 
It was the problem she created 
Are you on meth? Ana went trough so much for her sister. She almost died to help save Elsa. 
Because you have a cold heart. I c 
Ana is probably the most stuck up dumb bitch Disney has ever created
And I'm definitely an Elsa 
Higher chance for autographs man
I SWEAR ILL GET I
JAKE STFU FROZEN IS LIFE 
Lutfring are you more of an Elsa or Ana 
Frozen is bad. Too cold. Little mermaid gonna have other cutie sisters. More worth 
Frozen or bust 
Hahaha I think it's a lot of Disney there has to be a "full cast" list somewhere. I'd imagine @Ariel Tejada  has a part
Can we see the little mermaid. That's my favorite. I'll catch a hissy fit if its not. 
There is a frozen component to the show. Just saw a commercial for the show haha 
...
As long as it's frozen 
He didn't mention beer
I'm too yung for root beer

Some of the remixes of his songs are dope tho

Come to a legit grandmother house to cook legit Chinese food
Luther: *drops mike*
Chinese food here ain't Chinese food
Not if your on Long Island lore
All I'm saying is barbecue 
Like even Americans fuck up Italian food to the point of it being bad, it's just too good to ever be bad
LI pizza the bomb
And pizza is literally the worst thing an Italian can make 
Also pizza up here is trash 
I mean we chinese  have gotten away with feeding you fcks cats
I've never had a bad pizza
Italian is popular for a reason. Even when it's done bad, it's good 
I'm at work... Looks like someone ran out of points to make and changed the topic 
And grab a snickers. You are not you when you're hungry 
Mike go to work 
Lol America does Italian food well??? 😂😂
And you clearly didn't go to the right places 
The thing is, America does a shit job at Mexican food 
I've been to Mexico I prefer taco bell any day
Same for Mexicans tho farid
👏🏻👏🏻
How can Italian food be good if America can out do it all the time? Checkmate. Americans: 1 Italians: 0
Il Duce is my spirit animal

Olive Garden.
I was using your statement to show how ridiculous it was 
Carrabbas... Not Italian 
Farid, you have to come up with something more clever than what I said
Wait I thought Salsaritas was legit Mexican food
Spanish doesn't have shit. You ever have a ricotta stuffed ravioli a with a meat sauce? You ever have eggplant Parmesan with THREE types of cheeses? You ever have steak pizziola? You ever have stuffed ziti? I'm not talking about Olive Garden either that shit ain't Italian.... Fuck outta here...
Mighty taco mighty taco

I didn't realize how ghetto the outer parts of Manhattan were until I traveled all of it

Also LI is where it's at, we've got cool shit like trains that get you to somewhere not boring

I know it has rum in it. But since Stewart's doesn't sell it like that we gotta take it upon our selves 
Eggnog is supposed to be alcoholic

Halloween is over time for the spiked eggnog

he walked across campus with his dick in his hands
he said hey hey ladies im the bee bop man
he lined a hundred women up against the wall
bet a beta ten dollars he could fuck em all
he fucked 98 till his balls turned blue
he backed off and jacked off and fucked the other two
and when he died he went straight to hell
fucked the devil's daughter and his wife as well
and on his tombstone inscribed decree
here lies a mean sick fuckin' machine

RIT is still trying to figure out how to get money from us. Perception of Greek life won't be changing for a very long time but we can try and work on this campus to do so.
And since both Greek life and Athletics generate an extremely significant amount of revenue to universities, they used those programs to describe some reasoning behind why universities are so phobic to helping the Assaulted. Greed, money, power
Agree with Ben
They specifically pick out Greek life and Athletics becuase those are the two largest groups that can be labeled who perpetrate sexual assault and rape. But the message was not about who's doing it. The message is about how Universities are failing to handle it 
Yea I've dealt with that just from pledging alone. Lots of people judged me. It happens 
Is this what the founders would have wanted?
It's also a different story for different chapters. RIT greek life is very different
People who aren't around Greek life, or those who are around at least one bad one, don't always have nice things to say 
#believe 
Unfortunately for the most part they're not. That's just my experience 
I mean I have confidence that people are mature enough to not generalize Greek life for the mistakes of others. 
That's fair, I truly couldn't go, but that's what I have gathered thus far. Plz enlighten me
There was a section on Greeks but it wasn't all about it
#straightroasted
Though
It wasn't that
One of many reasons I didn't go. It sounds like it was just a movie about fk greek life, cus only Greeks have noncensual sex
Ahh
I just mean in terms of size 
By most influential, you mean good things right? 
Cause that was a lot of stuff about them
Its a good thing there isnt a chapter on campus, else they'd never hear the end of it
Proud sponsors of no more pledging 
/most influential 
Sigma Alpha Epsilon, they're general up there with us for largest

Yes we all know I don't always pick the best words @Juan Lachapelle 
I see now 
I'm confused 
My business was solely to clarify that you stuttered 
No mike, I havent done my mother's love
I apologize I should clarify. Have you done all three of those things, thus qualifying you to have an accurate idea of what each experience is like? 
#hungoverpresentation2015
I've been known to stutter on the occasion 
Have you done it Peter? 
Nope. 
^false 
I didn't stutter 
I didn't stiffer 
Not your mother's love or joining sigma chi?
But it was still the best thing to happen to my existence 
Unless you're a lead and the lot gets over run while you're on lunch break and the world is crumbling apart because of the problems occurring in your lot. 
Lots are the best thing that can happen to your existence 
You're in bed by like midnight just because you're exhausted 
You're always too tired to party lol
Doing the lots on move in day makes you a man
Misconceptions are common, we are really good at hiding our stress and how tired we are
And free stuff
I never partied as an OA you're too tired. People think that's all we do lol 
Its a lot of work, but it's also a ton of fun
There is a decent amount of responsibilities so it's not all just fun and partying but it is a great experience that I will always reccemend to people. Its also pretty competitive so don't expect a free pass if you apply
Lol, juan sold it way better
A week of training that will be more fun that you would ever imagine. The opportunity to be a leader and guide to 20 incoming freshman. The chance to build a family with your orientation team. More energy than you will find any other place on campus and an experience that will help you grow. 
Short commitment since its two weeks, Paid position, great way to meet people and get better integrated with RIT, very fun, gives you better people skills, something to place on your resume. Its fun as heck. 
We can talk about it but here's a quick list
Yeah and what are the perks?
I'm on the fence about that, what do you guys actually do out side of the oa stuff. Just party and shit or...?
Awesome!
Its not. I'll alert the chapter once it is. They do regular OA selections in spring
The regular OA application opens in march
Not for lead oa
Is the OA application still open? I know. I can google that. But.
Ariel should still probably use those pickup lines tho 
#monogate is over, everyone go home
Nerddd
That was gonna be my next step of any, but it gets in the way of coops and doesn't help me anymore than a lead position would 
It's like changing the building the buildings from numbers to names 
 I would SOC but its a year long position and I already have zero time
Yea I know. But that's such a large change it will prolly never click in my brain
#oa4lyfe
Yea we aren't OAs anymore. We're OLs
Lead is so much different you have no idea 
But being ON a team tho...
"SOPA" and "OPA"
But golf carts though......
I feel almost the same. I would not return as a lead. If I wasn't graduating I would either go for SOC or regular OA
I'll yell "I'm in a frat"
And lose my voice. That's another priority for me
I'll come and just yell how's that 
I still wanna bug out during orientation and meet the freshmen. 
My exact thoughts too Juan 
Focusing on coop or other things and I might not have time for lead unless they really need me. And returning as a lead is weird, doing it once is fine.
Gotcha. I assumed a lot of people wanted to be a lead again 
I gained a lot from orientation and lead so I wanted others to do the same 
I wanted to step down, and pass the torch 
Really though we need people in orientation
Wait wat. Y no lead again. 
Thats okay Juan I got a 6 year pin somehow take mine
That's fine, I likely won't either unless I'm a regular OA or they need me for something. Rip 4th year pin
Quitter
I'll just drop it here. I decided not to do orientation this year..
Gg*
I week session made me forget the lead application. Gf
Some of you guys better get lead, we need to assert our OA dominance
I'll slap you 
So you've changed about changing?
It'll be nice to have some consistency with that 
I think for initiations things won't change 
Oh god. 
You have no idea. That's OA mike. He's responsible
Lol 
I dealt with lutfring crap during orientation. There's more to it?
There are certain things that will change. But the basics are all the same. 
No dick showing and such?
I thought you've changed?
I can't wait till the new guys see what it's like to have a lutfring around 
There is no mercy for the wretched 
Lord have mercy on his soul
The disease is blood borne
You're all doing it wrong. Tell the officer you're in a frat, getting you out of the ticket. Proceed to grab his ticket book and write him a ticket for a DGDI (Driving as a God Damn Independent). Tell him you're incredibly ashamed of him, but not to let his sons make the same mistakes as he did. Then when his son rushes, don't give him a bid. Followed up by a ticket for being a GDI in public. Shame the bloodline... The entire.... Bloodline...
For the extra topper, invite the officers to your party. Bribe the officer to extending a bid to his geed son so he'll be a frat boy too
I feel that the bias is growing to be too much. The way that frat boys are being treated is ridiculous. When I say Im in a frat, the officer should apologize and compliment my George W. Blue polo and my salmon chubbys, then let me on my way
I use the "I'm in a frat" line in every opportunity I can. So far it's gotten me out of 4 parking tickets, 2 speeding tickets, 1 breaking and entering, 69 counts of public intoxication and 1 charge of public urination. 
Ben walks into class like "yeah im in a frat. We paint things"
Go change?

Too drunk for slap cup. I noped on that. Would have made throwing up longer than it already was 
👍
It's Leanne something
Who was this girl? Luna?
Good thing I don't know how to play slap cup lmao
Ha I already had it
Everyone who played her in slap cup needs to have work done. Don't let it sit. 

And regardless of severity or likelihood of people getting it, it was still irresponsible of them to let her attend. Mono also compromises your liver, and, it's still an infectious disease 
Based Mike with words of wisdom. 
@Ariel Tejada You should still get blood work done though 
Most of you probably already had it as kids and didn't know it. Let's not freak out about it until people start losing the ability to eat because of an extreme soar throat. (No, you probably aren't going to get mono.)
None
Yo just don't go to Ritz when I'm working. I'll contaminate your food. 
Just need to call my pediatrician and get some of that bubblegum flavored medicine that cures everything. 
Mono is worse when you're older, so yeah
I'm a big kid. I don't need no damn shots.
So should we have a pox party where we all make out with Ariel?
IT'S RELATED
Abstinence. Leaving room for Jesus.
You either got it as a kid and are immune, or its gonna rail you out when you're older. 
Sincerely, 
6 months and a surgery because of mono
Shit don't help with mono, bruh
This is a good reminder to get your flu shots kids

Mononucleosis becomes monoramorism-- one nucleus. one love.

This summer, Jake Gyllenhall stars in...
Be in a committed relationship so the infection becomes stronger after every time its transmitted. After some years, infect everyone. Take over the world.
Shit I don't let humor stand in the way of my jokes as you know
Don't let facts stand in the way of a good joke, Kevin
Hahahaha
(except mono is a viral infection so antibodies do nothing but ignore that)
Actually that's your next pickup line "kiss me so I can get some of your antibodies"
TIL Ariel is kill
I mean I left the party early so I don't know what happened afterwards. 
Her antibodies says otherwise
Hey, the girl liked it, so she put a "ring" on it
That's not how immune systems work Austin lol
I was just being a dick
It's ok, she can cure herself then you can take revenge and give it back
Conversation starter, "Hi, so, mono?"
Don't, if you both have it then you can't really kiss anyone else so you might as well start dating
Don't make it awkward. Just go with whatever intention you had before. Its being handled so enjoy coffee man. 
Cancel
Shit...
Oh bro...
All I know is this coffee date with her is gonna be aaaaaawkwaaaaard
Cause we are accountable for you.
Hey c'mon guise
@James Buxton is handling it
If you fucking had mono and we knew we would make damn well sure you didn't spread it at a social.
I am. They're not sufficient.
You aren't reading our points are you..
You're fucking with shit that shouldn't be fucked with. I don't want the chapter involved whatsoever. It's not our business. It's Ariels and Luna's.
You also have to consider the fact that this is an issue of being held accountable. We have no authority over this girl and can't do anything about this. However it should be addressed, whether to their chapter at large or just to this girl, so James would say something to their officials so that they can use their authority to either reprimand or discipline. It's also an official complaint showing that this isn't okay 
Damn, didn't everyone do the safety brief that RIT made us do as a freshmen? I think we should write a petition for them to better their program
Again...knowing you have a sti and choosing to put yourself in a position to share it or Knowing a member has it and allowing her to be in that situation during a social makes this nt okay (again speculating)
Knowing you have a disease that is easily spread and engaging in behavior that spreads it is immoral and unethical. We should refrain from commenting on if the organization knew or not until we have more information. Mono is something special, you can be bedridden anywhere from one week to multiple weeks-- that's the entire rest of the semester.
There's a blind line IMO. 
If the organization knew.that changes everything. 
Sharing drinks and kissing randos is how you get sick. Getting mono means nothing special it's just what he happened to have contact with. Although it's probably the worst case barring herpes it's a risk he and she took and the appropriate parties are already dealing with it. It shouldn't be an organizations problem. It's his and hers. 
Just wear a mouth condom. Problem solved. 
Like weeks

Do we know that she knew going to the party? She could have found out after 
How can you reconcile "not different at all" and "Worst case"
Mono can be considered an sti ...knowin you have an sti and still decidig to share it is fucjed up
Yea, if you have mono you shouldn't be going around 
Lol jk
None
Sidelined for a week > sidelined for a month 
Nah mono is worse
It's an inherent risk every single time. It's not different at all. It just so happens to be the worst case. 
^ second. #toothpasteequality
It is.
It is not different.
Yah i don't get all the hate, do you guys just really like crest or something?
Jake, why don't you go to Colgate then
Colgate has some good toothpaste. 
Mono is different, Ward
It is hysterical
FUCK COLGATE
People get sick all the time from parties and it's no big deal at all I don't understand why this is any different. It shouldn't be an issue. It's funny.
FUCK COLGATE
FUCK COLGATE

It's not hard to avoid contact with people. Only drink out of your own drinks, don't kiss randos, and don't play communal drinking games
Lol justin. They wanted to bring prank wars back. Here's mono yo. It's just a prank!
But let's not speculate any further, James is on it
"Don't ask, don't tell."
If they knew and did / said nothing, that's not good
Their
 biological warfare? That's fucking low
They shouldn't let members of they're organization participate devoid of risk management
Mono keeps you out of it for so long and is contagious even longer. It's not the organizations fault it's the two drunk teens faults
No, it wasn't a secret
Indeed
Isn't more on the individual
Absolutely 
Thats just on them, not on Ian 
Wtf
To answer your question yes she did
Ariel's immune system 
Sorry, that was a question 
Ive had a sore throat the whole day.....
She knew she had mono and still came
Risk was clearly not managed if mono girl was let in

Dear Diary:

The Gestapo entered the house today.  I fear for my safety and the safety of my family.  We've been in this attic for such a long time, it's hard to remember our lives before this.  Mother is frightened and I cannot comfort her.  This is true fear.
Fuck
